### Specific pain point for specific role

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Names an exact role (e.g., "VP of Treasury Operations") and an exact pain point with a specific scenario the reader would recognize from their own work. |
| 4     | Clear role identified, clear pain point, but the scenario is somewhat general rather than deeply specific.                                               |
| 3     | Role is implied but not named. Pain point is mentioned but broad (e.g., "payments teams struggle with fraud").                                           |
| 2     | No specific role. Pain point is generic and could apply to any industry.                                                                                 |
| 1     | No clear audience. No identifiable pain point.                                                                                                           |

### Within Devbrew's TAM

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Perfect fit: the post directly targets decision-makers at Series B-D or mid-market U.S.-based payments companies. The problem, language, and scale match this audience exactly. |
| 4     | Strong fit with minor stretch. The core audience is payments companies, but the problem could also apply to adjacent fintech segments.                                          |
| 3     | Fits payments broadly but is not specifically targeted to the TAM. Could apply to any financial services company.                                                               |
| 2     | Tangentially related to payments. More relevant to general fintech or enterprise software.                                                                                      |
| 1     | Outside TAM entirely. The topic has no clear connection to payments companies.                                                                                                  |

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | 3+ specific steps the reader can take this week. Each step is concrete enough to delegate to a team member (e.g., "Audit your top 3 transaction corridors for settlement timing variance"). |
| 4     | 2-3 actionable steps with clear timeframes, but some require interpretation or additional context.                                                                                          |
| 3     | Some actionable guidance, but steps are vague (e.g., "Review your fraud detection process").                                                                                                |
| 2     | Theoretical guidance only. The reader knows they should act but not specifically how.                                                                                                       |
| 1     | No actionable content. Purely descriptive or educational without practical application.                                                                                                     |

| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Reveals a non-obvious insight backed by data that the target audience likely has not encountered. Makes the reader reconsider an assumption. |
| 4     | Good insight that is mostly known to domain experts but framed in a new, valuable way.                                                       |
| 3     | Informative but no surprise factor. Covers well-known territory competently.                                                                 |
| 2     | Rehashes common knowledge without adding new perspective or data.                                                                            |
| 1     | Nothing new. The reader would not learn anything they do not already know.                                                                   |

### Technical depth appropriate

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5     | Technical depth matches the target role exactly. A CFO gets business impact and system architecture without implementation details. A VP of Engineering gets enough technical specificity to evaluate feasibility. |
| 4     | Slightly too technical or too simple in 1-2 places, but overall well-calibrated.                                                                                                                                   |
| 3     | Mixed: some sections hit the right level, others miss (too technical for the audience or too shallow for the topic).                                                                                               |
| 2     | Consistently wrong level. Writing for engineers when targeting CFOs, or oversimplifying for a technical audience.                                                                                                  |
| 1     | Completely mismatched. The technical depth makes the post unusable for the target audience.                                                                                                                        |

### Framework flows to Devbrew naturally

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | The reader naturally concludes "I need help implementing this" by the time they reach the Devbrew section. The 8-step framework builds a logical case without any forced transitions. |
| 4     | Clear path from problem to Devbrew, but one transition feels slightly abrupt or disconnected.                                                                                         |
| 3     | Framework is present but the flow from education to positioning feels forced or mechanical.                                                                                           |
| 2     | Disjointed. Hard to follow how the educational content connects to Devbrew's role.                                                                                                    |
| 1     | No logical flow. The Devbrew mention feels inserted rather than earned.                                                                                                               |

### Hidden difficulty is convincing

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5     | Honest, specific, and resonates. Explains what is genuinely hard (data pipelines, monitoring, retraining) without exaggerating. The reader recognizes these as real challenges their team faces. |
| 4     | Accurate description of difficulty, but slightly generic. Could apply to any ML implementation, not just this specific problem.                                                                  |
| 3     | Overstated or understated. Either makes it sound impossibly hard (creates skepticism) or too easy (undermines the need for Devbrew).                                                             |
| 2     | Clearly exaggerated to sell services, or dismissive of the reader's existing capabilities.                                                                                                       |
| 1     | Missing entirely, or so vague it adds no value.                                                                                                                                                  |

### Soft CTA is value-based

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Value-first, no pressure. Offers a specific deliverable (evaluation, audit, walkthrough) that the reader would want even if they never hired Devbrew. "No pitch" language present. Cal.com link included. |
| 4     | Good CTA with minor sales language. Still value-oriented but could be softer.                                                                                                                             |
| 3     | Mix of value and sales language. Feels like it is trying to be soft but defaults to selling.                                                                                                              |
| 2     | Direct sales pitch. "Book a demo," "schedule a call to learn more about our services."                                                                                                                    |
| 1     | Hard sell or missing entirely.                                                                                                                                                                            |

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Gives away the system freely. The reader understands exactly how the solution works and could theoretically build it themselves. Devbrew's value is positioned as implementation capacity, not secret knowledge. |
| 4     | Mostly transparent. 1-2 places where the explanation hedges or withholds detail unnecessarily.                                                                                                                   |
| 3     | Some transparency, some gatekeeping. Reader gets the concept but key details are vague.                                                                                                                          |
| 2     | Hides key information to create dependency. "Contact us to learn more" instead of explaining.                                                                                                                    |
| 1     | Lecture tone. Talks at the reader. Gatekeeps knowledge to force engagement.                                                                                                                                      |

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5     | "Custom AI trained on YOUR data" is the clear solution. Specific to the problem discussed. Distinguishes from generic automation, off-the-shelf tools, and rule-based systems. |
| 4     | AI is positioned as the solution but occasionally uses generic language ("AI-powered" without specifying custom).                                                              |
| 3     | AI is mentioned but not central. The solution could be achieved with non-AI approaches and the post does not make a compelling case for why AI is the right path.              |
| 2     | Generic automation language. "Automate your process" without AI specificity.                                                                                                   |
| 1     | No AI positioning. The solution described does not clearly involve AI or machine learning.                                                                                     |

## Voice compliance rubric (single 1-5 scale)

| Score | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Perfect compliance. Conversational tone throughout. Written WITH the reader using second person "you." No banned words. Active voice. Present tense. 8th grade reading level (or appropriate technical depth for the audience). No fabricated case studies or testimonials. No em dashes as sentence punctuation. |
| 4     | 1-2 minor violations. Example: one passive voice sentence, one section slightly above reading level, or one instance of a slightly elevated tone.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3     | 3-5 violations or one significant violation. Example: lecture tone in one section, multiple passive voice sentences, or one banned word.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2     | Pervasive voice issues. Too formal, too technical for the audience, or consistently talks AT the reader instead of WITH them.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 1     | Completely wrong voice. Academic paper tone, marketing hype throughout, or robotic/generic AI-sounding content.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Normalizing scores to section weights

The qualitative sections (audience value, conversion effectiveness) use 1-5 scales per criterion but need to map to their section weight in the overall 100-point score.

**Audience value:** 5 criteria x 5 points max = 25 points raw. Normalize to 15-point section: `(raw_sum / 25) x 15`

**Conversion effectiveness:** 6 criteria x 5 points max = 30 points raw. Normalize to 10-point section: `(raw_sum / 30) x 10`

**Voice compliance** is evaluated as part of the audience value assessment. It contributes to the overall qualitative picture but does not have its own weighted section. Include it in the report for visibility but factor it into the audience value score.
