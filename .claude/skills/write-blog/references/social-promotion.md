# Social media promotion guide

## AIDA formula

Use this framework for all LinkedIn and X/Twitter posts:

**Attention:** First line must stop the scroll. Use a specific pain point, surprising number, or bold statement that the target audience immediately recognizes.

**Interest:** Give an interesting fact, insight, or framing that makes the reader want to know more. Something they have not heard before or a reframe of something they already know.

**Desire:** Show them what their situation could look like with this solved. Make them want the outcome. Paint the "after" picture.

**Action:** Tell them exactly what to do next. Link to the blog post, suggest they book a call, or ask them to comment/share.

## Headline formula

`[Result they want] + [Objection] + [Time frame]`

Rules:

- Title case for headlines
- The title is your TAM (total addressable market)
- Create an emotional response with words like "steal," "lost," "missed"
- Use a single specific number, not a range

**Examples:**

- "How to Recover $47K in Settlement Float Without Changing Your Banking Partners in 60 Days"
- "The Correspondent Banking Fee Your Treasury Team Missed Last Quarter"
- "Why Your FX Costs Are 40% Higher Than They Should Be"

## LinkedIn post specifications

**Format rules (from performance data):**

- 100 words or less.
- Prose format ONLY. NO bullet points. Bullets signal "scan this" not "engage with this."
- Single specific pain point per post. Multiple topics dilute impact.
- Single specific number ("$47K" not "$40-80K").
- Line breaks every 1-2 sentences for mobile readability.
- End with a question or direct CTA, not "Read it" (too generic).
- No hashtags unless specifically requested.

**What works:**

- Hyper-specific treasury topics (settlement float, FX costs, correspondent fees)
- Strong first-line hook that creates urgency
- Conversational prose that flows naturally
- Specific numbers that surprise the reader

**What fails:**

- Posts over 147 words (3 consecutive days of zero engagement at this length)
- Bullet-point heavy structure
- Multiple pain points in one post
- Semi-technical framing for C-suite ("routing rules" sounds like engineering)
- Generic CTAs like "Read it"

**Posting schedule:**

- Monday through Thursday only
- Friday data is mixed (test cautiously)
- Hyper-specific treasury topics get the most algorithm reach

## X/Twitter post specifications

**Format rules:**

- 280 characters or less.
- Single hook + single insight + link or CTA.
- No threads. Single posts perform better.
- Post Monday through Thursday. Friday kills X reach (73% drop observed).

**What works:**

- Technical infrastructure content outperforms philosophical posts
- Thursday is the best day for X (45 impressions vs 12-17 other days)
- X engagement rate is 59x higher than LinkedIn (23.5% vs 0.4%)
- X drives 3x more blog traffic than LinkedIn despite 5x fewer impressions

**Key insight:** X is currently outperforming LinkedIn for engagement. Prioritize X strategy and effort.

| Format              | Prose, no bullets       | Single hook + insight    |

## Social post examples

**LinkedIn (good, 85 words, prose):**
Your payment routing probably runs 80% of volume through a single provider.

That is not a strategy. That is a single point of failure with zero cost leverage.

Most treasury teams never model what happens when that corridor shifts pricing or goes down for 6 hours. The downstream cost is not just the fee markup. It is the settlement delay, the reconciliation overhead, and the FX exposure you did not hedge.

Custom AI can model routing decisions across every corridor in real time.

**X (good, under 280 chars):**
Your settlement float is costing you $47K/quarter and your treasury team doesn't see it. Here's the fix: [link]
