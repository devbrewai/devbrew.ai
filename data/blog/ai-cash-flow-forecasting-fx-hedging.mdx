If you run treasury at a payments company, you already know the feeling.

If you are cross border, this hits harder, because multi currency settlement timing and corridor volatility amplify every forecasting miss.

Twenty plus currencies. Settlement timing that never behaves. Corridors that spike at the worst possible time. And a hedging program that has to protect earnings while the business grows and changes under your feet.

Most teams think their FX hedging problem is a hedging problem.

It usually is not.

It is a forecasting problem.

When the forecast is wrong, you hedge too much, tie up cash, and pay carry you did not need. Or you hedge too little, scramble into spot, and explain an avoidable earnings hit.

HSBC's corporate risk management survey, referenced by the Association of Corporate Treasurers, reported that [**57 percent of CFOs**](https://www.treasurers.org/hub/treasurer-magazine/how-treasurers-can-manage-fx-risk-optimise-tech) said unhedged FX risk reduced earnings over the prior two years, rising to [**77 percent in EMEA**](https://www.treasurers.org/hub/treasurer-magazine/how-treasurers-can-manage-fx-risk-optimise-tech).

That is not a lack of hedging tools. That is a lack of reliable forward looking visibility.

## Your cash forecast is costing you money

Most Series B to C payments finance teams still forecast cash the same way they did at Series A.

Spreadsheets. Historical averages. A monthly roll forward. A buffer on top, just to be safe.

The problem is the buffer becomes the strategy.

If you are forecasting EUR exposure of \$10M and your process routinely misses by 15 to 25 percent, you are not a bit off.

You are wrong by \$1.5M to \$2.5M.

That gap turns into:

- Over hedging, which locks in forwards you did not need and ties up working capital
- Under hedging, which forces emergency spot conversions when markets are least friendly
- Hedge ratios based on comfort, not reality, because the forecast is not trustworthy

This is why CFOs experience hedging as expensive even when it works.

## Why traditional forecasting breaks in cross border payments

Cross border flows are not one cash stream. They are a portfolio of corridors with different behaviours.

- High volatility corridors can move hard in a week
- High volume corridors can move slightly and still matter, because the notional is huge
- Customer payment timing changes with product launches, fee changes, seasonality, and macro shocks
- Settlement and payout timing changes with rails, cut offs, and bank behaviour

A monthly forecast treats all of this as one blended average. That is the mistake.

Treasury then does the logical thing, it hedges conservatively to avoid being surprised. It just pays for that conservatism.

## The three hedging mistakes that quietly inflate cost

### Mistake 1, hedging on monthly projections instead of actual cash timing

A month old forecast is not a plan, it is a memory.

Payments volumes shift daily. Payout timing shifts daily. Corridor mix shifts daily. Your hedge programme reacts too late.

### Mistake 2, treating every currency like it deserves the same strategy

Not all exposure is equal.

A currency with lower notional but higher volatility can deserve more protection than a stable corridor with huge volume. Static hedging does not prioritise. It averages.

### Mistake 3, assuming forecast error is inevitable

Treasury teams build buffers because they have learned to distrust the forecast.

But it is possible to materially reduce short horizon error when you model cashflow timing with the right data and the right controls.

ASML publicly reported improving FX exposure forecasting accuracy from [**70 percent to 96 percent**](https://treasurytoday.com/asa-2024-winners/asml-improves-forecasting-with-open-source-ai/) using an internal AI approach.

You do not need perfection. You need the forecast tight enough that your hedge ratios stop being driven by fear.

## What AI cash forecasting actually means in treasury terms

Forget the buzzwords for a second.

AI cash forecasting is a system that produces three outputs your treasury team can actually use:

1. **A currency level cashflow forecast by horizon**, usually daily and weekly first
2. **A confidence band around that forecast**, so you know what is reliable and what is not
3. **A hedge recommendation that stays inside your policy**, based on exposure and confidence

The value is not that it predicts the future.

The value is that it tells you, with measurable accuracy, what you need to hedge, when, and how aggressively, without widening buffers just to feel safe.

## How it works, without the science project

### Step 1, unify the cash reality across systems

The system pulls the data you already have, then reconciles it into one consistent view:

- Payment platform and ledger events
- Bank and settlement data
- Payout schedules and corridor level clearing times
- Customer behaviour, including who pays early, late, or unpredictably
- Known future items like fees, settlements, and contractual flows

Most payments companies have the data. The hard part is stitching it together so treasury can trust it.

### Step 2, start with the corridors that actually move the needle

You do not start with one hundred models.

You start with the top five to ten corridors that drive exposure and cost. That gets you a real business result fast.

Then you expand.

### Step 3, forecast cash timing, then quantify uncertainty

The forecasting goal is practical, reduce error at daily and weekly horizons where hedging decisions actually change.

Treasury friendly measurement looks like this:

- Weekly MAPE, or mean absolute percentage error, on top corridors
- Bias checks, are you consistently over or under forecasting
- Coverage checks, do your confidence bands reflect reality

You want to be able to say, for EUR and GBP, our weekly error dropped from double digits to low single digits, and we know when the model is unsure.

### Step 4, translate forecast confidence into hedge ratios inside policy

This is where finance leaders relax, because it becomes governed and controllable.

Example logic that stays inside policy:

- High confidence near term exposure, hedge more with forwards
- Medium confidence, hedge less or shorten duration
- Low confidence, use options, collars, or stay within your existing buffers

The point is not to create a new hedge policy. The point is to execute your current policy with better information.

### Step 5, deliver recommendations through your existing workflow

This can start as decision support and graduate into automation.

Day one can be a dashboard and a weekly recommendation pack for treasury committee.

Later, you can integrate with your TMS for trade ticket creation, approval workflows, and execution.

## How this stays inside hedge policy, and inside audit expectations

CFOs do not buy black box hedging. Treasurers do not either.

A production grade system should include:

- **Audit trail** for every forecast, every recommendation, and every parameter change
- **Human in the loop controls**, approvals, limits, and segregation of duties
- **Policy constraints** hard coded, corridor limits, notional caps, allowed instruments
- **Fallback modes**, if confidence drops or data quality degrades, revert to your current hedging bands
- **Model monitoring**, drift detection, data anomalies, and escalation workflows
- **Explainability at the driver level**, what changed, volume, timing, corridor mix, settlement lag

This is how you keep it boring in the best way.

Better forecasting should reduce risk, not introduce a new kind of risk.

## What savings look like when you stop hedging the buffer

A realistic outcome is not zero error. It is that your hedging cost stops being inflated by uncertainty.

When weekly forecasts tighten and confidence bands become reliable, you can:

- Reduce over hedging, so less cash is tied up in unnecessary forwards
- Reduce emergency spot conversions, because exposure surprises drop
- Optimise hedge tenors, so you pay carry for the period you actually need
- Prioritise hedging where volatility and notional justify it

This is where a 30 to 40 percent hedging cost reduction becomes believable, because it is driven by waste removal, not by taking more risk.

## Why internal builds stall, even with strong teams

Most internal attempts fail for reasons that have nothing to do with modelling.

### Data engineering is the real project

Payment data changes. Schemas change. IDs do not reconcile cleanly between payment platforms, banks, and the ledger.

If the data is not continuously reliable, the forecast is not continuously reliable. Treasury stops trusting it. The programme dies quietly.

### Operationalising the system is harder than building the model

A real system needs:

- Scheduled retraining
- Monitoring and alerting
- Versioning, rollback, and reproducibility
- Access controls and audit logs
- High availability APIs or reports

That is engineering work, not a notebook.

### Integration is where nice forecast becomes real savings

If the output does not land where treasury works, in the TMS, in the cash positioning workflow, in the reporting cadence, it will not change decisions.

## A 90 day implementation plan that finance leaders can actually approve

### Days 1 to 30, data audit and baseline

- Map data sources and reconcile IDs end to end
- Establish baseline accuracy on top corridors
- Define success metrics, weekly MAPE, bias, and confidence coverage

### Days 31 to 60, corridor pilot forecasting

- Build forecasts for the top five to ten corridors
- Backtest against recent history
- Produce weekly recommendation packs and compare to current approach

Target outcome, a clear accuracy lift on weekly horizons, and a measurable reduction in surprise exposure events.

### Days 61 to 90, workflow integration and controlled rollout

- Deliver dashboards and structured outputs treasury can act on
- Add approval workflows and policy constraints
- Run parallel, model recommendations versus existing hedges, then quantify savings

At day 90, you should have enough evidence to decide whether to scale.

No faith required.

## How Devbrew builds this for cross border payments teams

We build custom AI cash forecasting systems designed for the reality of cross border payments.

That means:

- Data pipelines from your payment platform, ERP, bank data, and TMS
- Corridor level forecasting with confidence bands that treasury can trust
- Controls, audit trails, and monitoring that fit finance governance
- Delivery into your current workflow, not a separate tool nobody uses

We focus on one thing, turning forecasting accuracy into lower hedging waste, without changing your risk posture.

## Want to pressure test this against your corridors

If you are a CFO, Treasurer, or Finance Director, you do not need a generic AI chat.

You need clarity on three things:

- What is driving forecast error across your top corridors
- What that uncertainty is costing you in hedge carry, over hedging, and emergency spot
- Whether a forecasting system can reduce hedging waste without changing policy or increasing risk

That is what this call is for.
