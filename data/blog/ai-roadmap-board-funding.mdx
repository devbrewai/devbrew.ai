You present your AI roadmap to the board. Three slides in, your lead investor asks: "What does this do to gross margin by Q3?" You do not have a number. The AI roadmap gets tabled behind two sales hires and a compliance build. Not because AI was wrong, but because every other ask on the table had a dollar figure attached to it.

## Why most AI roadmaps die in the boardroom

AI gets pitched as a technology investment. Boards fund business outcomes. That disconnect kills more AI initiatives than bad models ever will.

Gartner found that 30\% of GenAI projects get abandoned after proof of concept, citing unclear business value, escalating costs, and poor data quality among the reasons.[^1] RAND research shows 80\% of AI projects fail, at twice the rate of non-AI IT projects, with root causes including misalignment between project intent and business goals.[^2] And BCG's 2025 study of 1,250 firms found only 5\% generate AI value at scale. The other 60\% report minimal gains.[^3]

At a Series B payments company, board time is scarce. You are competing against headcount requests, new market launches, and compliance builds. "We should explore ML for fraud" loses to all of them. "ML fraud scoring will reduce false positives by 40\%, recovering \$1.2M in approved revenue per quarter" competes on equal footing.

When your investors are tracking burn rate and path to profitability, every dollar needs a projected return. AI that cannot show one gets cut first.

## How a board-ready AI roadmap works

The fix is structural. Every AI initiative needs to speak the same language as every other budget request on the table.

1. **Start with the KPI, not the model.** Identify the 3 to 5 metrics your board already reviews. Fraud loss rate, approval rate, manual review cost, transaction margin, time to settlement. Every AI initiative must map to one of these.

2. **Quantify the gap.** Baseline the current metric, model the improvement, calculate the dollar impact. "Our false positive rate is 5\%, costing us \$800K per quarter in blocked legitimate transactions" is a board sentence. "We want to try ML for fraud" is not.

3. **Sequence by ROI and feasibility.** Rank initiatives by expected return and implementation complexity. Quick wins first. They build credibility and fund the harder projects.

4. **Define success criteria before you build.** Each initiative gets a go/no-go metric at 90 days. If the pilot does not move the target KPI, you kill it or pivot. Boards fund discipline, not hope.

5. **Build the feedback loop.** Show how each completed initiative feeds data and learnings into the next one. Compounding value is what separates a roadmap from a wish list.

## The mistakes that get AI roadmaps killed

**Leading with technology instead of outcomes.** "We need a transformer-based anomaly detection system" means nothing to a CFO. "We can cut manual review costs by 50\% and recover \$2M in approved transactions per quarter" gets a follow-up question. As Harvard Business Review found in 2025, most AI pilots fail because they lack the organizational scaffolding to connect technical potential to business impact.[^4]

**Treating AI as one big initiative.** A single "AI transformation" budget line is the easiest thing to cut. At a Series A-C company, every dollar is visible. Three \$200K projects with clear outcomes survive budget cuts better than one \$600K "AI strategy." When your board reviews quarterly, they want each project pulling its weight independently.

**No kill criteria.** If you cannot define what failure looks like at 90 days, the project looks like a money pit. Define the exit ramp and you earn the right to keep going.

## What happens when you get this right

When your roadmap leads with KPIs and dollar impact, the board conversation changes. It stops being "should we fund AI?" and becomes "which initiative do we fund first?" That shift is the difference between a tabled roadmap and an approved budget line.

In payments, the use cases map cleanly to board-level metrics. AI-powered payment routing can [cut costs 18 to 25\%](/blog/payment-routing-optimization) without renegotiating provider terms. That is the kind of initiative a board funds because it maps directly to margin recovery in dollars. As we covered in [showing ROI](/blog/show-roi) before anything is built, the strongest AI roadmaps prove the return before the first line of code ships.

The data backs this up. Deloitte's Q4 2025 CFO survey found 87\% of CFOs expect AI to be extremely or very important to their finance operations. But among those actively using it, only 21\% say it has delivered clear, measurable value.[^5] The gap is execution, not enthusiasm. Companies that close it see 1.7x revenue growth compared to those that do not.[^3]

## Why most payments teams cannot do this alone

The hard part is not building the model. It is three things.

**Translating AI into board language.** Most ML engineers cannot speak CFO. Most finance teams cannot evaluate AI feasibility. At a 50 to 150 person payments company, you probably do not have both skillsets on the same team. That gap is where roadmaps die.

**Sequencing for compounding value.** Which project generates the data that makes the next one better? Which quick win funds the longer build? Series A-C companies cannot afford to run parallel experiments. Your board measures capital efficiency, so you need the sequencing right the first time.

**Building production systems, not demos.** A POC in a notebook is not a roadmap deliverable. Production ML needs data pipelines, monitoring, retraining, and integration with your payments stack. Gartner projects that 60\% of AI initiatives will be abandoned due to lack of AI-ready data alone.[^6] Your engineering team is already stretched across product, compliance, and infrastructure. Pulling them off the roadmap for a six-month ML build is not realistic.

## How to build your first board-ready AI roadmap in 30 days

**Week 1: Audit your board metrics.** Pull the last four board decks. List every KPI the board reviewed. Identify which ones have the most room to move and which ones leadership brings up repeatedly. These are your target KPIs.

**Week 2: Map AI to the gaps.** For each target KPI, ask: is there a decision in our payments flow that a model could make faster, cheaper, or more accurately than the current process? Document the baseline, the estimated improvement, and the dollar impact.

**Week 3: Score and sequence.** Rank each initiative on two axes: expected ROI and implementation complexity. Start with high ROI, low complexity. Those are your quick wins.

**Week 4: Build the one-pager per initiative.** Each initiative gets: target KPI, current baseline, projected improvement, dollar impact, 90-day success metric, estimated cost, and dependencies. This is what goes in front of the board. Not a pitch deck. A business case.

## How Devbrew helps you get there

That gap between ML engineering and board language is where we come in. At Devbrew, we work with payments teams to identify which initiatives will move the needle, model the expected ROI, and build the production systems end to end. Data pipelines, ML models trained on your transaction data, decision APIs, monitoring, and retraining infrastructure.

Off-the-shelf tools optimize for generic patterns. Your payment corridors, customer mix, and risk profile need models built on your data. We build these across fraud detection, payment routing, risk scoring, and compliance automation, and every system maps directly to the KPIs your board already tracks.

## Next step

If you are building an AI roadmap and want to pressure-test it before your next board meeting, we can walk through it together. We will discuss the challenges you are facing, what is at stake if they stay unsolved, and where AI creates the most leverage in your payments stack. You will leave with clarity on direction.

When booking, share a brief description of your problem and what is at stake. That helps us make the most of our time together.
