Your team closed dozens of disputes last month. How many did you win? Global chargeback volumes are projected to hit 324 million by 2028, a 24\% increase from 2025.[^1] For cross-border payments companies, that growth compounds fast: more jurisdictions, more evidence requirements, tighter deadlines on every case. If your dispute process still runs on spreadsheets and support tickets, you are leaving winnable revenue on the table.

## Why chargebacks are a representment problem

Every chargeback is a decision. Fight it or write it off. If you fight, the outcome depends on three things: the right evidence, the right response format for the reason code, and submitting before the deadline.

Most teams get one of those three right. Maybe two on a good day. The reason code determines what evidence the network needs. A fraud claim needs different proof than a "product not received" dispute. A cross-border transaction needs documentation from multiple systems across jurisdictions. Harder to gather, harder to get right.

AI can optimize all three variables simultaneously across every open case. It matches reason codes to evidence requirements, pulls the right records from your systems, assembles the response in the format the network expects, and submits on time. Every time.

## How AI-powered dispute management works

Here is the system, step by step.

1. **Ingest the dispute and classify by reason code.** The model reads the incoming chargeback notification and maps it to Visa, Mastercard, or other network-specific reason codes. This determines the entire response strategy.

2. **Pull evidence automatically.** Transaction records, authorization logs, delivery confirmations, customer communications, and device data. The system connects to your existing data sources and assembles what the network requires for that specific code.

3. **Select the optimal response template.** Different reason codes need different evidence packages. The model picks the template with the highest historical success rate for that code and transaction type.

4. **Assemble and submit the representment package.** Evidence is ranked, formatted to network specifications, and submitted before the deadline. No analyst touches the case unless it falls outside the model's confidence threshold.

5. **Feed outcomes back into the model.** Every win and loss becomes training data. The system learns which evidence combinations work for which reason codes and adjusts future responses.

## The mistakes payments teams keep making

**Writing off winnable disputes.** An estimated 45\% of chargebacks involve first-party misuse, where the real cardholder made the purchase and then disputed it.[^1] These are winnable with the right evidence. But most teams do not have the capacity to fight them, so they absorb the loss.

**Assigning disputes to support teams.** Customer support agents handle chargebacks as a side task. They do not know that Visa's dispute response window for U.S. merchants is now just 9 days.[^2] They do not know that a reason code 13.1 requires different evidence than a 10.4. Network rules are dense, they change frequently, and getting them wrong means an automatic loss.

**Applying one response to every dispute.** A single template for all chargebacks is like using one antibiotic for every infection. Reason codes exist because different dispute types need different proof. The model should decide the strategy, not copy-paste.

This is the same operational trap we see across risk functions. As we covered in [how manual review erodes margins](/blog/manual-review-cost-automation), linear processes break when volume scales. Chargebacks are no different.

## The numbers behind the problem

The cost per incident goes beyond the transaction amount. U.S. merchants now lose \$4.60 for every dollar of fraud when you factor in fees, operational overhead, and downstream consequences.[^3] For a mid-market payments company processing \$500M annually with a 0.5\% chargeback rate, that is roughly \$11.5M in total chargeback-related costs per year. Improving your win rate by even 20 percentage points on that \$2.5M in disputes recovers \$500K in annual revenue that would otherwise be written off.

And those numbers keep growing. Global chargeback losses are projected to reach \$41.69 billion by 2028, up from \$33.79 billion in 2025.[^1] In North America alone, that figure hits \$20.47 billion.[^1] U.S. financial institutions average more than 200 back-office staff dedicated to chargeback management.[^1] If you are a cross-border company dealing with [multi-jurisdictional complexity](/blog/crossing-borders-breaking-systems), your per-case cost is higher because evidence spans more systems and regulatory contexts.

## Why most teams cannot build this internally

The concept is straightforward. The implementation is not.

Production-grade dispute automation needs integrations with your payment processor, CRM, shipping provider, and authorization system. It needs a reason code classifier trained on thousands of resolved disputes. It needs response templates that stay current as networks update their rules.

Cross-border adds another layer. Different jurisdictions have different evidence standards. A dispute on a UK-to-US corridor requires different documentation than a Brazil-to-US corridor. The model needs to understand those differences and pull the right evidence accordingly.

The hard part is not the AI. It is the data pipeline connecting your fragmented systems, the integration layer that keeps everything in sync, and the monitoring that catches drift before it costs you cases.

## What you can do in the next 60 days

**Weeks 1-2: Audit your win rate by reason code.** Pull 90 days of dispute data. Segment by reason code. You will likely find that 3 to 5 codes account for 80\% of your volume, and your win rate varies wildly between them.

**Weeks 3-4: Map your evidence gaps.** For each top reason code, document what evidence the network requires and what your team actually submits. The gap between those two lists is your lost revenue.

**Weeks 5-6: Time your response cycle.** Measure how long it takes from dispute notification to representment submission. Compare against network deadlines. If you are cutting it close on Visa's 9-day window, you are almost certainly missing cases.

**Weeks 7-8: Tag and segment.** Classify your chargebacks into true fraud, friendly fraud (first-party misuse), and merchant error. The Merchant Risk Council's 2025 data shows first-party misuse remains one of the most prevalent fraud types globally.[^4] Knowing your mix tells you where automation will have the highest ROI.

## How Devbrew builds AI-powered dispute systems

At Devbrew, we build custom AI dispute management systems end to end. Evidence pipelines that connect to your transaction data, reason code classifiers trained on your historical disputes, response assembly that follows network specifications, and deadline tracking across every open case.

Unlike off-the-shelf dispute platforms, every model is trained on your data, your outcomes, and your dispute patterns. The system plugs into your existing stack and reaches production in weeks, not quarters, handling the engineering complexity your team should not have to build from scratch.

## Next step

If chargebacks are growing faster than your team can manage, we can walk through where your current process is leaving revenue on the table.

The goal of this conversation is to understand the dispute challenge you are facing, what it is costing you, and where AI creates meaningful leverage in your chargeback workflow. You will leave with clarity on options, direction, and whether Devbrew can help.

When booking, share a brief description of your challenge and what is at stake. It helps us make the most of our time together.
