You priced that wire at \$30. Your bank quoted \$25. Easy \$5 margin.

Correspondent banks took \$40 from the transfer. The recipient got shorted. When you make your customer whole, that \$5 margin becomes a \$35 loss.

Multiply that across 200 daily transactions. Some corridors are worse, some better. But you're leaking margin on routes you can't predict.

This is the correspondent fee problem. And if you're processing \$100M or more in annual wire volume, it's costing you \$125K every year in fees you can't predict, can't price for, and can't control.

## Where the margin actually goes

You already know how correspondent banking works. Your outbound SWIFT payments hop through intermediary banks, sometimes three to five of them, depending on the corridor. Each intermediary deducts a fee directly from the transfer amount before passing it along.

Your banking partner quotes you \$25 per wire. That's their fee. But each correspondent in the chain takes another \$15 to \$25, and those fees stack with every hop. The [World Bank's Q1 2025 data](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/) shows bank-initiated cross-border transfers cost [14.55\%](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf) on average, the highest of any service type. Most of that gap is intermediary fees that never appear in your quoted rate.

You're pricing transactions based on what you can see. You're losing margin on what you can't.

## Why prediction is so hard

You've built integrations to PIX, SEPA, UPI. You have multiple banking partners across corridors. You know alternative rails exist.

The problem isn't awareness. It's that the number of intermediaries and fees [vary by corridor](https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-roadmap-for-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2025/), by amount, by time of day, and by banking relationships that change without notice. You can't price accurately because you can't predict the path each payment will take.

Your ops team reconciles daily. They see the gaps. But turning that into pre-transaction routing decisions at scale? That's a different problem entirely. If you're already fighting [multi-currency reconciliation](/blog/payment-reconciliation-automation) fires, correspondent fee unpredictability adds fuel.

## The patterns that compress margins

Most payments companies make these problems worse without realizing it.

**Pricing off quoted fees, not actual costs.** Your banking partner says \$25, so you price \$30 and assume \$5 margin. But when correspondent fees eat \$40, you're underwater on every transaction. The pricing model is built on incomplete data.

**Treating all corridors the same.** Your US to UK volume might average one intermediary (\$15 hidden fee). Your US to Brazil volume might average four (\$60 hidden fee). Same quoted fee from your bank. Dramatically different actual cost. Without corridor-level visibility, you're cross-subsidizing unprofitable routes with profitable ones.

**Routing by default, not by cost.** You have SWIFT and local rails. But transaction routing is often rule-based or manual, not optimized per payment. The same [routing optimization logic](/blog/payment-routing-optimization) that cuts processor costs applies to correspondent fees, but most payments companies aren't applying it.

**Accepting unpredictability as normal.** Correspondent fees feel like weather. Unpredictable, unavoidable. But they're not random. They follow patterns based on corridors, banks, amounts, and timing. Patterns that can be learned.

## The math on what you're losing

For a company processing \$100M in annual wire volume (roughly 4,000 transactions), the numbers look like this:

Hidden correspondent fees average \$125K annually. With better routing, you can reduce that by 35\%, recovering \$45K per year. More importantly, you can price accurately, protecting margin on every transaction instead of hoping it works out.

At \$250M in wire volume, the leakage scales to \$275K annually. Optimization recovers \$100K or more. And the data gives you negotiation leverage with banking partners you didn't have before.

## What you can do in the next 60 days

Start by mapping actual costs by corridor. Pull 12 months of transaction data and calculate the gap between quoted fees and actual deductions for your top five corridors. Most teams find 2-3 corridors that are dramatically more expensive than they assumed.

Next, analyze your routing decisions. For each corridor, compare SWIFT costs versus local rail costs for the same transaction types. You may already have cheaper rails available that aren't being used optimally.

Then aggregate fee data across banking partners. If you have multiple banks for the same corridor, compare their actual correspondent costs, not just their quoted fees. The [FSB's 2025 progress report](https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-roadmap-for-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2025/) notes that correspondent fee transparency is improving, but you still need to track it yourself.

## Why this is hard to automate internally

The challenge isn't knowing what to optimize. It's building systems that make routing decisions automatically, per transaction, in real time.

Predicting correspondent fees requires machine learning trained on your specific transaction history, your corridors, your banking relationships. Off-the-shelf tools give generic estimates based on industry averages. They don't know that your Frankfurt correspondent charges 40\% more than your London alternative for the same destination.

Custom AI learns your patterns. It maps routes before each payment. It recommends the lowest-cost path for each specific transaction. And it continuously adapts as your banking relationships change.

Most payments companies don't have the ML engineering capacity, data pipelines, or monitoring infrastructure to build this in-house. The model itself is straightforward. The production system behind it is not.

## How Devbrew approaches this

At Devbrew, we build custom correspondent fee prediction systems for cross-border payments companies. We aggregate your multi-bank transaction data, train ML models on your corridor-specific patterns, and deploy real-time fee prediction before payment initiation.

The output: a routing layer that optimizes per transaction, a dashboard showing predicted versus actual fees by corridor, and evidence you can use in banking partner negotiations.

Deployed in 60 days. Built on your data, not industry averages.

## Next step

If you can't predict what recipients will actually receive before you send, you're compressing margin on every transaction.

We're happy to talk through your corridors and help you think through whether this approach fits your volume and banking setup.
