Every remittance transaction is a multi-variable optimization problem you are solving with a static answer.

You maintain relationships with 10 to 20 payout partners per corridor, each with different pricing, speed, reliability, and coverage. But most companies assign a default partner and leave it. Finance teams negotiate rates annually, set the routing table, and move on.

The result? Global remittance costs average [6.49\%](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf) for sending \$200. Sub-Saharan Africa faces [8.78\%](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf), with South Africa to China reaching [over 23\%](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf). The UN SDG target is [under 3\%](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-0C-01.pdf) by 2030. That gap is not a pricing problem. It is a routing problem.

ML-powered payout routing treats every transaction as a fresh decision, selecting the optimal partner in real time based on current FX spreads, fee schedules, liquidity, partner uptime, and recipient preferences. The logic is simple. The execution is where it gets hard.

## How the routing system works

The system runs five steps for every transaction:

1. **Ingest real-time data.** Pull live pricing, FX rates, liquidity depth, and uptime status from every partner across every corridor.

2. **Score each partner per transaction.** Evaluate cost, speed, reliability, and recipient preference. A mobile money payout to Nairobi has different optimal routing than a bank deposit to Lagos.

3. **Route to the best partner.** If the model predicts the primary partner will fail, it automatically routes to the next best option before the transaction is attempted.

4. **Feed outcomes back.** Every completed or failed transaction improves the model. Success rates, actual settlement times, real FX spreads versus quoted.

5. **Monitor and retrain.** Corridor performance shifts weekly. Partner pricing changes. New mobile money corridors open. The model adapts continuously.

Mobile money channels already achieve [3.54\% average cost](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-for-development/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cross-border-Mobile-Money-Remittance-Cost-Survey.pdf) compared to the 6.49\% global average. Intelligent routing steers transactions toward these cheaper rails when the recipient can accept them. Sub-Saharan Africa alone has [1.1 billion mobile money accounts](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/mobile-money-surpasses-two-billion-registered-accounts-and-over-half-a-billion-monthly-active-users-globally/). The infrastructure exists. The optimization layer is missing.

## The mistakes that keep costs high

**Default routing without review.** One partner per corridor, set and forget. Your \$200 transfer to Ghana costs 8\% through Partner A when Partner B charges 5\%. You never check because the routing table has not changed in a year.

**Ignoring FX as a cost lever.** Transfer fees dropped from 6.84\% to 4.13\% since 2011. But FX margins stayed flat at [roughly 2\%](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf). FX is now the biggest controllable cost component, and most teams treat it as fixed.

**No systematic partner monitoring.** Partners degrade silently. Only [35\% of retail](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P211024-3.pdf) cross-border payments settle within one hour globally. Without tracking per-partner settlement speed and success rates, you cannot redirect volume when performance drops. As we explored in [reducing cross-border payment failures](/blog/payment-recovery-ml), the difference between 11\% and 2\% failure rates often comes down to knowing which partner to avoid before the transaction is sent.

## What the numbers look like

World Bank data shows the three cheapest qualifying providers in each corridor average 3.21\% cost, compared to the 6.49\% global average, a [50\% gap](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf). Intelligent routing that optimizes across cost, speed, and reliability captures 60 to 70\% of this gap. That is where the 35\% cost reduction comes from.

Cross-border payments fail at roughly 11\%, with [82\% of firms](https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PYMNTS-Cross-Border-Sales-and-the-Challenge-of-Failed-Payments-February-2024.pdf) unable to diagnose failure causes. Predictive routing that pre-screens partner availability and reroutes before a failure occurs brings that 11\% down to roughly 8\%, a 25\% improvement.

Only [35\% of cross-border retail payments](https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P211024-3.pdf) settle within one hour, with most taking one to five days through correspondent banking. Routing that shifts volume to same-day channels, mobile money, fast payment links, local rails, reduces average settlement from roughly 48 hours to under 29 hours, a 40\% improvement.

For an operation spanning 40 corridors on \$500M annual volume, the [2.94 percentage point gap](https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q125_1_0.pdf) between average cost (6.49\%) and the cheapest digital providers (3.55\%) means capturing even 30 to 60 basis points through dynamic selection yields \$1.5M to \$3M in annual savings. Not from renegotiating rates. From routing smarter with the partners you already have.

Global remittance flows hit an estimated [\$905 billion](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/peoplemove/in-2024--remittance-flows-to-low--and-middle-income-countries-ar) in 2024. As we covered in [optimizing FX and routing margin](/blog/routing-agents-fx-margin), 20 bps of savings on \$100M monthly volume equals \$2.4M per year from one improvement loop.

## Why most teams cannot build this internally

The hard part is not the model. It is the system behind it.

You need real-time data pipelines across 10 to 20 partners per corridor, each with different API formats, rate structures, and reporting cadences. Just normalizing pricing into a comparable format is a project in itself. ML models need corridor-specific training data because what works for US to Mexico does not apply to UK to Nigeria. FX margin monitoring requires sub-second latency. Failure prediction requires clean historical data that most teams do not have in usable format.

Then there is the operational layer. Continuous retraining infrastructure with drift detection. Fallback logic that avoids double payments when a primary partner times out. Reconciliation across providers with different settlement reporting. And all of it needs to run without slowing down your transaction flow.

Most remittance operations teams have the domain expertise but not the ML engineering capacity to maintain this in production. The complexity of [multi-provider optimization](/blog/payment-routing-optimization) compounds as you add corridors.

## How to start in the next 90 days

You do not need a full ML system to begin capturing value.

**Week 1 to 2:** Audit your current routing logic. Map which partner handles which corridor and document why. Most teams discover routing decisions made years ago that no one has revisited.

**Week 3 to 4:** Build a cost comparison dashboard. Pull actual landed costs, fees plus FX spread, per partner per corridor for the last 90 days. This shows you exactly where the gaps are.

**Month 2:** Identify your top 5 corridors with the highest cost variance between partners. These are your quick wins.

**Month 3:** Implement rule-based routing for those 5 corridors, steering to the cheapest partner that meets your speed and reliability SLA.

That gets you the first layer of optimization. ML takes it further by handling all corridors continuously, adapting to real-time conditions, and predicting failures before they happen.

## How Devbrew builds this

At Devbrew, we build ML-powered payout routing systems that optimize across your entire partner network. That means data pipelines connecting every partner API, custom models trained on your corridor data, real-time decision APIs that select the best route per transaction, and monitoring that catches drift before it costs you money.

Our models ingest real-time pricing, liquidity conditions, and partner performance across all your corridors to route each transaction for the best combination of cost, speed, and reliability. The system improves continuously as it processes more transactions, so cost savings compound as you scale.
