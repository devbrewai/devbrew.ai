### When expansion turns monitoring into risk

If you are operating in multiple markets, AML regulatory change management stops being a checklist and becomes a moving target.

Not because your team is weak. Because the workload does not scale.

In practice, different regulators publish updates in different places, in different formats, on different schedules, with different definitions, and different enforcement priorities. If those changes live in people's browsers and inboxes, your coverage is always fragile.

The fix is simple in concept.

Centralize regulatory intake, then use natural language processing to convert unstructured updates into structured obligations your team can assign, review, evidence, and track.

That is what a regulatory intelligence platform is meant to do.

### Why this problem keeps getting harder

Penalties are rising, and the gap between "we tried" and "we can prove it" is where regulators apply pressure.

Fenergo's analysis of publicly available enforcement data found that regulators issued about 139 penalties in the first half of 2025 totalling about \$1.23B, a 417\% increase versus the same period in 2024. The fines related to AML, KYC, sanctions, suspicious activity reports, and transaction monitoring violations.

When that happens, your board asks a simple question.

How do we know we are not missing something important?

A manual process struggles to answer that confidently, because it is built on effort, not evidence.

And when a single enforcement action crosses nine figures, the cost of weak evidence becomes visible.

On February 24, 2025, the US Department of Justice announced that Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd., the operator of the OKX exchange, pleaded guilty and agreed to pay penalties totalling more than \$500M. Source: [DOJ press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/okx-pleads-guilty-violating-us-anti-money-laundering-laws-and-agrees-pay-penalties)

You do not need to claim every enforcement action is caused by missed regulatory updates to see the point.

If your monitoring is informal, your controls drift. Drift is where exam findings and penalties start.

### Regulatory horizon scanning that actually scales

Here is what "regulatory horizon scanning" looks like when it is built as a system, not a habit.

Clear enough to understand, specific enough to evaluate, still hard enough to implement properly.

### 1. Start with an explicit regulator map

List the sources that shape your obligations today, then expand jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

For many cross border payments teams, the core set includes:

- [FinCEN](https://www.fincen.gov/) in the US
- [FCA](https://www.fca.org.uk/) in the UK
- [FATF](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/) standards and updates
- EU level developments, including [AMLA](https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en)

The goal is not vague "global coverage."

The goal is explicit coverage. You want to know exactly what you monitor, and what you do not.

### 2. Capture updates automatically, store the raw source, preserve version history

This is where many teams quietly fail.

They read updates, but they do not preserve them in a way that is searchable, auditable, and tied to decisions.

A defensible automated regulatory monitoring system stores:

- the original source link
- the raw text or document
- the publication date
- when your organisation first reviewed it
- any later updates, corrections, or replacements

That is the start of an examiner ready audit trail.

### 3. Use NLP to pull out obligations, not just summaries

Natural language processing here means one thing.

Turn legal and regulatory text into structured fields.

For each update, the system pulls out:

- what changed
- who it applies to
- effective dates and deadlines
- impacted area, for example KYC, transaction monitoring, sanctions, or reporting
- a plain language summary that can be routed and reviewed

This is where AML regulatory change management stops being a reading problem and becomes a workflow problem.

### 4. Maintain a living regulatory obligations register

A regulatory obligations register is your single source of truth for what you must do, by jurisdiction, by topic, with ownership and status.

This is how you stop "monitoring" from being an activity and turn it into a controlled process.

Every obligation should have:

- jurisdiction
- topic area
- summary of the change
- effective date
- control owner
- status
- evidence location

### 5. Run a consistent impact review workflow

Every new obligation goes through the same path:

- relevance check
- impact review, what policies, controls, scenarios, or reporting need to change
- assignment to a control owner
- evidence plan, what you will show, and where it will live

This is the point where multi jurisdiction AML compliance becomes manageable.

### 6. Send the change to the systems you already run

The obligations register is not the end product. Your controls are.

So the system should produce outputs your team can use immediately, such as:

- a jurisdiction specific change summary
- a list of impacted controls and owners
- suggested updates for review in transaction monitoring and KYC workflows
- prompts for what evidence to capture during implementation and testing

This is how a regulatory intelligence platform creates leverage without forcing a process rewrite.

### Two examples that matter in payments

### Travel Rule compliance is uneven

FATF's 2024 targeted update found that 70\% of survey respondents had passed legislation implementing the Travel Rule, but supervision and enforcement remained low. It also reported that only 26\% of jurisdictions that had passed legislation had taken certain supervisory or enforcement actions focused on Travel Rule compliance. Source: [FATF targeted update PDF](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/2024-Targeted-Update-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf)

That gap matters because you can be expected to comply even when counterparties are not enforced at the same level.

A system helps you track jurisdiction status, align policy expectations, and document why you made the decisions you made.

### ISO 20022 changes data, and data changes controls

SWIFT states that the coexistence period for cross border payments messaging ends on 22 November 2025. Source: [SWIFT ISO 20022 timeline](https://www.swift.com/standards/iso-20022/iso-20022-financial-institutions-focus-payments-instructions)

For compliance leaders, the issue is simple.

If message structures change, your screening logic, monitoring logic, reporting logic, and data lineage often need to change too.

A good system flags standards migrations like ISO 20022 compliance alongside classic AML updates, because they land in the same operational pipeline.

### The traps that keep teams stuck

These patterns show up constantly at Series B and C.

### Treating monitoring as a junior task

You get surface coverage, not dependable coverage.

You may catch big headlines, but miss scope changes, interpretation shifts, and subtle cross jurisdiction differences.

### Confusing alerts with intelligence

Newsletters help, but they do not prove coverage.

If you cannot answer what you monitor, what you missed, and what you decided, you do not have regulatory intelligence. You have information.

### Not connecting change to controls

A regulatory update is not useful until it maps to:

- a policy
- a control
- a control owner
- evidence

This mapping is repetitive, and that is why it must become a system.

### Struggling to prove review history

Examiners do not want your intentions.

They want documented review, decisions, timelines, and evidence. A system produces this by default.

### What results you should expect, in plain compliance terms

Exact percentages vary by organisation, so the clean way to do this is to measure your baseline.

What is consistent is what improves:

- Fewer missed updates, because coverage is explicit and intake is continuous
- Faster impact reviews, because obligations arrive structured and pre categorised
- Cleaner examiner narratives, because sources, decisions, and evidence live in one place
- Clear ownership, because every obligation has an accountable control owner

If you want a number your team will trust, use the one you already have.

How many hours per week does your team spend on regulatory monitoring today?

A solid system should materially reduce that number. Then you measure it and decide if it is worth scaling.

### Why internal builds usually break

This is where most teams underestimate the work.

The hard part is not extracting text. The hard part is building something compliance can trust.

Here is a real failure mode you can picture.

A regulator changes a webpage template, your scraper stops, and you do not notice because nothing "breaks" loudly. Two months later, an examiner asks why you missed an update that should have changed a control, and your only answer is that nobody saw it.

That is why reliability, monitoring, and governance matter more than the model.

In many internal builds, things fail when:

- sources change formats, links break, and document structures shift
- output quality controls are missing, so misclassifications slip through
- the obligations register is not connected to owners, evidence, and existing workflows
- governance is missing, including approvals, overrides, and audit logs

If any of those are weak, you get a tool that demos well and collapses under real operations.

### What you can do in the next 30 days

If you want traction without a huge project, do this.

### Week 1, inventory jurisdictions and sources

- List current jurisdictions and the next set you plan to enter
- List the regulators and sources you rely on right now
- Identify the biggest gaps, meaning jurisdictions with no clear monitoring owner

### Week 2, define the fields in your obligations register

Keep it minimal:

- jurisdiction
- topic area
- summary of the change
- effective date
- control owner
- status
- evidence location

### Week 3, standardise review and escalation

- Define what "urgent" means internally
- Define who reviews what
- Define a review deadline for each urgency level

### Week 4, pilot on a small set of jurisdictions

Pick a handful that represent real complexity.

Track two things:

- what the system captured that manual monitoring missed
- what manual monitoring captured that the system missed

That tells you what to improve before scaling.
