Every cross-border payments company has the same spreadsheet. Ten currency accounts. Fifteen. Sometimes twenty. Each one funded with a buffer that was set months ago based on historical averages and gut feel, because the alternative, underfunding and missing a settlement, is worse.

The logic is sound. The cost is not.

Overfund and capital sits idle. Underfund and payments fail. Most treasury teams land on overfunding because a missed settlement is visible and immediate, while idle capital is silent and cumulative. That trade-off, repeated across every nostro and vostro account, is how [millions in working capital](/blog/working-capital-optimization) quietly disappear into buffers that exist to absorb uncertainty rather than serve actual payment volume.

The way out is corridor-level AI forecasting: predicting how much to fund each account, in which currency, and when. Instead of uniform buffers sized for worst-case scenarios, dynamic funding levels based on predicted demand by corridor and time window.

## How corridor-level forecasting works

The architecture is five steps.

**Step 1: Aggregate demand signals by corridor.** Pull transaction data, settlement schedules, partner payout patterns, and external signals like remittance calendar events, FX volatility, holidays, and currency cut-off times. Each corridor gets its own data view.

**Step 2: Train corridor-specific forecast models.** EUR-USD behaves differently from GBP-NGN. Monday volumes look nothing like Friday volumes. Each model learns the daily, weekly, and seasonal rhythms of its specific corridor.

**Step 3: Generate probabilistic funding forecasts.** Not point estimates but confidence-weighted ranges by currency and time window. Treasury sees what is likely, what is possible, and what is unlikely across each account.

**Step 4: Dynamically adjust funding levels.** Instead of static buffers, the system raises or lowers nostro balances based on predicted demand. High-confidence quiet period? Reduce funding. Settlement spike approaching? Increase proactively.

**Step 5: Feed settlement outcomes back into the model.** Every actual settlement becomes training data. The model improves continuously, and forecast accuracy compounds over time.

This is the same architecture behind [predictive liquidity systems](/blog/real-time-treasury-brain-predictive-liquidity) applied specifically to the nostro pre-funding problem.

## The three mistakes that keep nostro capital trapped

**Uniform buffer ratios across all corridors.** A 15\% buffer might be right for your EUR-USD corridor and wildly excessive for GBP-EUR. Applying the same ratio everywhere guarantees you are overfunding low-volatility accounts and potentially underfunding high-volatility ones.

**Forecasting on historical averages.** Last quarter's average daily volume tells you almost nothing about next Tuesday. Day-of-week effects, month-end spikes, partner settlement schedules, and seasonal patterns all create variance that trailing averages miss entirely.

Strategic Treasurer's 2025 Cash Forecasting and Visibility Survey found that 53\% of treasury professionals now rate cash forecasting as "difficult," up from 39\% in 2018.[^1] The problem is getting harder, not easier.

**Brittle spreadsheet models.** Excel forecasts work until they do not. They cannot adapt when you onboard a new corridor, when a partner changes settlement timing, or when volumes shift seasonally. Manual models break silently, and by the time treasury notices, the buffer has already absorbed the error.

## What the numbers look like

The evidence for AI-driven treasury forecasting is building fast.

Bosch reduced its cash buffer by 30\% after deploying AI-based treasury forecasting, according to KPMG's 2025 report on AI in corporate treasury.[^2] ASML improved FX exposure forecasting accuracy from 70\% to 96\% using an internal AI approach.[^3] These are not theoretical gains. They are production results from companies managing real multi-currency exposure.

The accuracy improvement from [AI cash forecasting](/blog/ai-cash-flow-forecasting-fx-hedging) translates directly into lower idle capital. When your forecast is tight, you stop compensating with oversized buffers.

Frame the ROI simply: a payments company holding \$5M across 15 nostro accounts with a 25\% reduction in idle capital frees \$1.25M. That is capital available for growth, not sitting in a low-yield currency account waiting to absorb forecast error.

For a Series B-D company, \$1.25M freed from nostro buffers extends runway, strengthens the next board update, and gives treasury a capital efficiency story backed by data rather than estimates.

## Why most teams cannot build this internally

The concept is straightforward. The execution breaks most internal teams for four reasons.

**Scattered data.** Nostro balance data lives across payment platforms, banking portals, SWIFT messages, and internal systems. Building a clean, consolidated view by corridor is a multi-month data engineering effort before any ML work begins.

**Continuous retraining infrastructure.** A model trained once degrades quickly. You need ML infrastructure that retrains on fresh settlement data daily or weekly, not batch predictions run once a quarter.

**Workflow integration.** Forecasts sitting in a dashboard do not change funding decisions. The system needs to feed directly into treasury workflows, funding triggers, and settlement processes.

**Domain expertise gap.** ML engineers do not understand liquidity mechanics. Treasury teams do not have ML experience. The intersection of payments domain knowledge and production ML engineering is where most internal projects stall.

Most companies need at least 12 months of settlement history by corridor to train accurate forecast models, and even with sufficient data, building the pipeline to keep those models current is a separate engineering challenge.

## What you can do in the next 90 days

You do not need a full build to start quantifying the opportunity.

**Weeks 1 to 2: Audit nostro balances versus actual utilization.** Pull 90 days of daily balances and actual settlement volumes by corridor. Calculate the average idle percentage per account. This shows you where capital is trapped and by how much.

**Weeks 3 to 4: Map corridor-specific patterns.** Take your top five corridors and chart day-of-week and month-end patterns. Identify which corridors have predictable demand and which are volatile. This tells you where forecasting will have the most impact.

**Weeks 5 to 8: Build a simple rolling forecast.** Start with your highest-volume corridor. Build a basic rolling forecast using the patterns you identified and measure accuracy against actual funding needs. Even a simple model reveals how much lift is possible.

**Weeks 9 to 12: Quantify the idle capital cost.** Compare your predicted funding needs to actual balances. Calculate the difference as idle capital. Multiply by your cost of capital. That number is what you are paying for forecast uncertainty.

## How Devbrew builds this

At Devbrew, we build corridor-level forecasting systems for cross-border payments companies. Custom AI trained on your transaction data, your corridors, your settlement patterns.

The system includes multi-provider data connectors that consolidate nostro balances from banking portals, SWIFT messages, and payment platforms into a single corridor-level view. Forecast models are trained per corridor and retrain automatically as new settlement data arrives.

Funding recommendations feed directly into your existing treasury workflows and settlement processes, no rip-and-replace. The result is treasury operations that scale with your volume without guesswork.

## See where your nostro capital is trapped

If you are managing pre-funding across multiple currency accounts, we can map where capital is idle and how much corridor-level forecasting could free.

30-minute conversation: we will walk through the problem, what is at stake, and where AI creates leverage for your specific corridors.
