Your sanctions screening system flags a transaction. An analyst spends ten minutes reviewing it and clears it as a false positive. Then they do it again, hundreds of times a day.

You already know this is expensive. The true cost is worse than most teams calculate.

## The math your team is absorbing

Peer-reviewed research shows sanctions screening generates false positives on over 90\% of all alerts.[^1] Even well-tuned systems at mid-market payments companies typically see false positive rates of 30 to 50\%. For every real match your team catches, they wade through dozens of legitimate transactions that never should have been flagged.

Take a cross-border payments company processing 50,000 transactions a month. If your screening engine flags 10\% and 90\% of those are false positives, your analysts manually review 4,500 legitimate transactions every month.

At 10 minutes per review and a fully loaded analyst cost of around \$65 per hour (median base of roughly \$37 per hour plus benefits and overhead)[^2], that is 750 hours and roughly \$49,000 per month in analyst time spent confirming "this is fine."

Nearly \$600,000 a year. And it scales linearly. Double your volume, double your compliance labor.

Here is the trap: you cannot turn sensitivity down. OFAC operates on a strict liability basis.[^3] A single missed match can trigger penalties reaching tens of millions per violation.[^4] So you keep sensitivity high, accept the false positive flood, and throw bodies at the problem.

This breaks the moment your volume outpaces your hiring capacity.

## Why your screening engine generates so much noise

Most sanctions screening relies on string matching. It compares names against watchlists using fuzzy text similarity. Basically a spelling test.

String matching answers "do these two names look similar?" It does not answer "is this the same person?" Those are different problems.

"Mohammed Al-Rahman" in Ohio matches "Mohamed Al-Rahmani" on a watchlist because the strings look close. Your system has no context beyond the name, so it flags the transaction. An analyst checks customer history, confirms it is the same remitter as last month, and clears it. Next month, the same alert fires again.

Multiply this across common name patterns, transliteration variants, and shared business suffixes, and you get a queue that never shrinks.

## The fix: contextual matching and automated disposition

Stop treating sanctions screening like a spelling problem. Treat it like entity resolution.

Instead of "do these names look similar?" the system asks "based on all available evidence, is this the same real-world entity?"

Here is how the system works:

1. **Normalize and enrich inputs.** Clean names, resolve transliterations, standardize addresses, pull structured data like dates of birth, nationalities, and document identifiers.

2. **Score using contextual signals.** Combine name similarity with geographic context, transaction patterns, customer history, and entity type. Weight rare name tokens higher than common ones.

3. **Route into three lanes.** Clear non-matches auto-resolve. Clear matches escalate immediately. Ambiguous cases go to analysts with full reasoning attached.

4. **Learn from decisions.** Every cleared false positive and confirmed match becomes training data. Your analysts teach the system every day.

5. **Monitor and retrain.** Track false positive rates, clearance times, and detection accuracy. Retrain when watchlists update or customer patterns shift.

A 2025 Federal Reserve working paper validated this approach, finding AI-powered screening reduced false positives by 92\% while improving detection rates by 11\%.[^5]

## Three mistakes that keep teams stuck

**Accepting false positives as the cost of compliance.** "We would rather over-flag than miss something" sounds prudent until your team spends 80\% of its time on alerts that were never real threats. As we explored in [how to reduce AML false positives in payments](/blog/aml-false-positives-payments), the better frame is improving precision so your team focuses on cases that actually matter.

**Hiring instead of fixing.** When alert volume grows, the default is more analysts. But headcount scales linearly with volume. AI-powered screening scales sublinearly. At some point you cannot hire fast enough, and the quality of rushed reviews degrades anyway.

**Treating all alerts equally.** A weak match on a common name is not the same as a strong match with shared date of birth and nationality. Without risk-based triage, your senior investigators spend the same time on obvious false positives as on genuinely suspicious hits.

## What the numbers look like after the fix

Federal Reserve research shows AI-powered screening can reduce false positives by over 90\%.[^5] McKinsey found ML-based approaches improved suspicious activity identification by up to 40\% and increased operational efficiency by up to 30\%.[^6] Based on these benchmarks, a 50 to 70\% reduction in alerts requiring human review is a reasonable target for well-implemented systems.

For that same team processing 50,000 monthly transactions, the math shifts. Your 4,500 monthly false positives drop to 1,350 or fewer. Your analyst queue goes from 750 hours to under 250. That is 375 to 525 hours per month you redirect to true risk investigation, exam preparation, or supporting volume growth without proportional hiring.

Detection accuracy stays the same or improves. You are not reducing sensitivity. You are reducing noise.

## Why most teams cannot build this internally

The concept is clear. The production system is the hard part.

You need data pipelines connecting KYC systems, transaction data, and watchlist feeds. Entity matching models tuned for your corridors. Scoring infrastructure at low latency. Audit trails that satisfy examiners. Monitoring that catches drift before regulators do.

Most Series B to D payments companies do not have ML engineers who understand both production systems and regulatory compliance. As we covered in [sanctions screening 2.0](/blog/sanctions-screening-entity-matching), the hard part is not the model. It is the system behind it.

## What your team can do in the next 30 days

**Week 1: Measure your baseline.** Pull your false positive rate, average clearance time, and alert volume by corridor. You cannot fix what you have not quantified.

**Week 2: Categorize your noise.** Tag your top 100 false positives by root cause: common names, transliteration mismatches, shared business suffixes, repeat alerts on known customers. You will find 3 to 4 patterns driving most of the volume.

**Week 3: Identify quick wins.** For repeat alerts on previously cleared customers, implement suppression rules with audit logging. This alone can typically cut alert volume 10 to 20\%.

**Week 4: Build the business case.** Calculate analyst hours on false positives, cost per alert, and projected savings from a 50\% reduction. Use this to justify a screening overlay investment.

## Where Devbrew fits

Devbrew builds ML-powered sanctions screening overlays that sit on top of your existing platform. The models we build learn the difference between "Mohammed Al-Rahman" who sends monthly remittances to Jordan and a sanctioned individual with a similar name, and document the reasoning in examiner-ready format.

Our approach includes data pipelines, entity matching models trained on your transaction patterns, real-time scoring APIs, automated disposition, and monitoring tied to compliance outcomes.

You can see this architecture in practice in [Sentinel](/work/sentinel), where we built a sanctions screening engine with sub-50ms latency and 97.5\% precision against OFAC watchlists.

Your screening platform stays in place. Your analysts keep the tools they know. What changes is the signal-to-noise ratio.
