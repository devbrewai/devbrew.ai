Your treasury team is flying blind. Right now, \$2 million to \$5 million sits trapped in settlement float across your cross-border payment providers. Most treasury managers at payments companies processing \$100M+ annually spend 15-20 hours per week manually reconciling settlements across 3-5 providers. By the time you discover a settlement issue, you've already lost 2-3 days per corridor.

You can recover 20-30\% of that trapped float in 60 days with the right system. That's \$400K to \$1.5M back in your accounts. Your treasury team stops firefighting and starts deploying capital strategically.

## Why cross-border settlements trap your cash

Every cross-border transaction flows through a settlement chain: your customer sends payment, it hits your processor, moves through correspondent banks with different clearing timelines, reaches your settlement partner, and lands in your account. Most payments companies work with 3-5 settlement providers across different corridors, each operating on different clearing schedules, reporting data in different formats, with corridor-specific delays you can't see until funds actually clear.

The result? Manual Excel reconciliation, matching incoming wires against expected settlement dates, discovering discrepancies 2-3 days after they occur. A typical \$150M volume company has \$3.2M in trapped float across EUR, GBP, and AUD corridors. EUR settlements clear 1.5 days slower than quoted, GBP shows a 23\% exception rate with 2+ day delays, AUD has no consistent pattern.

That unpredictability forces treasury teams to maintain working capital buffers of \$5M+ just to cover settlement uncertainty. The opportunity cost runs \$200K+ annually. While your cash sits trapped, competitors with better visibility deploy theirs for growth.

## The mistakes treasury teams make

**Treating it as a settlement problem instead of a data problem.** You're getting end-of-day reports when you need real-time visibility. You're seeing aggregate numbers when you need transaction-level tracking. You're reacting to cleared funds when you should be predicting clearing windows. Your providers have the settlement data—they're just not surfacing it in a way that lets you act on it.

**Manual reconciliation at scale.** At \$50M annually, 18 hours per week of Excel reconciliation is manageable. At \$100M, it's unsustainable. At \$200M+, you need a full-time person doing nothing but settlement reconciliation. Meanwhile, most treasury teams can't tell you their current in-transit cash within \$500K or which corridors are bleeding the most capital.

**Reactive firefighting.** Your provider reports a delayed settlement. You email support. Three days later, you get an explanation. This cycle repeats weekly. Your treasury team becomes expert firefighters instead of strategic capital deployers.

## How real-time settlement visibility actually works

The fix is a system that gives you three capabilities: real-time settlement tracking, predictive clearing models, and automated reconciliation.

**Real-time settlement tracking** connects directly to your payment providers' APIs. Every transaction gets tracked from initiation to final clearing. You see which batch each transaction is in, which correspondent banks are processing it, and where it sits in the clearing chain.

**Predictive clearing models** use historical settlement data to forecast when funds will actually clear. The model learns corridor-specific patterns: EUR to USD settles in 1.2 days on average, but Mondays add 0.3 days and month-end adds 0.5 days. GBP to USD has a 23\% exception rate tied to specific correspondent bank windows. These aren't generic estimates—they're trained on your actual settlement history.

**Automated reconciliation** matches expected settlements against actual clearing in real time. When a \$200K GBP settlement is predicted to clear Tuesday at 2 PM but hasn't appeared by 3 PM, the system immediately flags it and routes an alert with the provider's contact info, settlement history, and escalation path. Routine variances get logged, material exceptions trigger immediate escalation with provider-specific context.

## The 60-day implementation roadmap

**Days 1-15: Baseline audit and data mapping**

- Map settlement infrastructure: providers, corridors, data formats, current reconciliation process
- Calculate trapped float: measure time from initiation to clearing across 90 days of settlement data
- Most teams discover 30-40\% more trapped float than estimated

**Days 16-30: Infrastructure and connectors**

- Build API connectors to payment providers (authentication, rate limits, normalization)
- Implement reconciliation engine with fuzzy matching and transaction ID mapping across systems
- Deploy baseline dashboard: float by corridor, pending settlements, clearing volumes

**Days 31-45: Predictive models and detection**

- Train corridor-specific clearing models on historical data
- Model outputs: predicted clearing date/time, confidence interval, exception risk score
- Tune exception detection (typically start with 24+ hour delays or \$50K+ thresholds)

**Days 46-60: Refinement and optimization**

- Refine dashboard based on treasury feedback
- Implement automated workflows for common exceptions
- Train model on resolution patterns

By day 60, your treasury team transitions from reactive reconciliation to proactive management, forecasting clearing with 5-10\% accuracy instead of 20-30\% variance.

## What recovering trapped float actually means in dollars

For a \$100M annual volume company processing \$8.3M monthly across three corridors, typical trapped float is \$568K. Breaking it down: EUR to USD (\$4M monthly, 1.5-day clearing = \$200K float), GBP to USD (\$3M monthly, 2-day clearing with 23\% exception rate = \$260K float), AUD to various (\$1.3M monthly, 2.5-day average = \$108K float).

Conservative 20\% recovery: \$114K back in your accounts within 60 days. Aggressive 30\% recovery: \$170K. This comes from accelerating clearing by 0.3 days, reducing exception rates from 23\% to 15\%, and optimizing submission timing.

But that's just cash flow. Your CFO can reduce working capital buffers by \$300K-\$500K because cash flow becomes predictable. Your treasury team saves 12-15 hours per week. You gain complete audit trail visibility for regulatory reporting.

Scale this to \$200M annual volume: \$1M+ in trapped float with \$200K-\$300K recoverable in 60 days. At \$500M+ volume: \$2M-\$3M in float with \$400K-\$900K recoverable.

## How Devbrew delivers this in 60 days

At Devbrew, we build production-grade AI and ML systems for cross-border payments infrastructure. Here's what we deliver:

**Multi-provider data connectors and normalization.** API integrations that work with your existing providers, handling authentication, rate limiting, and format changes. Every settlement transaction flows into a unified tracking system within 15-30 minutes with mapped transaction IDs and normalized amounts.

**Corridor-specific clearing prediction models.** Trained on your actual settlement history, learning patterns specific to your providers and corridors. Models output predicted clearing times with confidence intervals and exception risk scores.

**Automated reconciliation and exception detection.** The system matches cleared funds against expected settlements automatically, flags exceptions based on your thresholds, and routes them with full context. Multi-stage alerting: routine variances logged, material exceptions escalated immediately.

**Treasury dashboards with drill-down visibility.** Treasury managers see current float by corridor, pending settlements by provider, and predicted clearing for 3-7 days ahead. CFOs see aggregate views, trending, and variance from predictions.

**Continuous model retraining and monitoring.** As correspondent banks change schedules and providers optimize infrastructure, models retrain automatically. We track accuracy, exception resolution times, and trapped float recovery with quarterly reviews.

**Integration with existing treasury systems.** We're not replacing your TMS. We add real-time visibility and predictive clearing to what you already have, delivering in weeks by focusing exclusively on this domain.

The result: recover 20-30\% of trapped float within 60 days, your treasury team stops firefighting settlement exceptions, and your CFO gets reliable cash flow forecasting.

## Why your internal team can't build this in 6 months

The concept is straightforward. The execution is where most internal builds fail.

**Multi-provider data normalization.** Your EUR provider returns settlement data in one format, your GBP provider uses a completely different schema, your APAC provider has a third. Each updates at different frequencies, handles transaction IDs differently, and reports fees with different precision. Building connectors and normalization logic for 3-5 providers is a multi-month engineering effort.

**Predictive modeling for financial data.** You need models accurate enough for treasury teams to trust but robust enough to handle corridor-specific edge cases. A model that's 85\% accurate sounds good until it misses a \$200K settlement exception. Exception detection that separates normal variance from material delays without crying wolf requires domain expertise in both ML and treasury operations.

**Production reliability at scale.** This system runs 24/7, pulling data from external APIs that go down, change formats without warning, or hit rate limits. Most internal builds work fine in development and fall apart in production. You spend six months building the initial system, then another 3-4 months hardening it. During those 9-10 months, you've leaked another \$200K-\$600K in trapped float.

## What you can do today

Start quantifying the problem before implementing a full system:

**Audit your last 90 days of settlements.** Calculate average time from initiation to clearing for each corridor. Identify which corridors have the highest variance and which providers consistently miss quoted clearing times.

**Calculate your trapped float.** For each corridor, multiply average daily volume by average clearing time in days. Sum across all corridors.

**Track exceptions manually for 30 days.** Document every late settlement: provider, corridor, days delayed, amount impacted. This establishes baseline exception rates.

**Measure reconciliation time.** Track hours per week your team spends matching settlements, investigating discrepancies, and following up with providers.
