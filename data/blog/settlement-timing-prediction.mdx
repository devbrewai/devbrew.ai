You send a \$200K payment to a vendor in Singapore on Monday morning. SWIFT confirms it left your bank. By Wednesday, the vendor asks where the money is. Your ops team calls the bank. No clear answer. The payment lands Thursday afternoon. Four days.

Meanwhile, a \$150K payment to the UK that you sent the same day landed in 6 hours. Same bank. Different corridor, different result.

Your treasury team can't tell which payments will take 6 hours and which will take 4 days. So you hold buffers large enough to cover the worst case on every corridor. That's \$1M sitting idle that could be funding growth.

You're holding seven figures idle because you can't answer a simple question: when will this payment land?

## The speed vs. timing gap

Here's the part that confuses most finance teams: cross-border payments are fast. [90\% reach the destination bank](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-cross-border-payment-processing-speed-stretches-further-ahead-g20-target) within one hour. That's well ahead of the G20's 2027 target.

But "reaching the bank" and "landing in the recipient's account" are two different things.

Only [43\% actually credit](https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-data-shows-focus-needed-beneficiary-leg-faster-international-payments) to the end customer within that hour. The FSB's 2025 progress report shows even starker numbers: just [35\% of retail payments](https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-roadmap-for-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2025/) get credited within one hour. The target is 75\%, and we're nowhere close.

The gap comes from what happens after the payment arrives. Local processing, regulatory checks, correspondent bank handoffs. Statrys analyzed 2,000 SWIFT payments and found [75\% involve intermediaries](https://tools.statrys.com/blog/how-long-does-a-swift-transfer-take). Each intermediary adds roughly 3 hours. Payments without intermediaries averaged 15 hours. Payments with them averaged 1 day and 11 hours.

Corridor matters too. For US-based payments companies, outbound US-UK payments might clear in under a day. US-India averages 3 days due to Reserve Bank of India requirements. Friday payments sit until Monday.

## Why unpredictability costs you money

If you can't predict when a specific payment will settle, you can't optimize your liquidity position. So you hold buffers. Globally, over [\$4 trillion sits idle](https://www.iamtn.org/blog-posts/how-arf-unlocks-liquidity-in-cross-border-payments) in pre-funded accounts because of this exact problem.

For a company processing \$100M in annual cross-border volume (roughly \$8.3M monthly), a typical 10-15\% liquidity buffer means \$830K to \$1.25M sitting idle. At 8\% opportunity cost, that's \$66K to \$100K per year in trapped capital.

But the buffer is just part of the cost.

Your ops team spends 15-20 hours per week chasing settlement status. Funds go "missing" in the correspondent chain for days with no way to track movement in real time. CFOs and treasury teams consistently cite lack of visibility into settlement timelines as their biggest cross-border frustration.

And there's a downstream effect. Treasury holds outbound vendor payments until inbound settlements are confirmed. When settlements are unpredictable, downstream payments are unpredictable too. Vendors get paid late. FX exposure windows widen. The uncertainty cascades.

This connects directly to the float problem we covered in [The \$2M to \$5M Sitting in Your Settlement Pipeline](/blog/settlement-float-recovery). Unpredictable timing is what makes that float so hard to recover.

## The mistakes that make it worse

**Treating all corridors the same.** Your US-UK payments might average one intermediary and settle in under a day. Your US-Brazil payments might average three intermediaries and take 3-4 days. Same buffer percentage applied to both means you're overfunded on fast corridors and underfunded on slow ones.

**Using averages instead of distributions.** "Settlements take 1-3 days" is what your bank tells you. But the average hides the variance. Some corridors have tight distributions (UK: 6-18 hours). Others have wide ones (India: 1-5 days). A buffer sized for the average doesn't protect you against the tail.

**Not tracking actual timestamps.** Most teams track when payments were sent and when they were confirmed received. Few track the actual elapsed time by corridor, by bank, by amount, by day of week. Without this data, you can't identify patterns. Without patterns, you can't predict.

**Waiting for confirmation before releasing downstream payments.** This seems prudent, but it creates cascading delays. If you're also dealing with [unpredictable correspondent fees](/blog/correspondent-fees-hidden-costs) eating into margin, the uncertainty compounds.

## How settlement prediction actually works

Custom AI trained on your transaction history can predict when each specific payment will settle before you send it.

**Historical pattern analysis.** ML models trained on 12+ months of your settlement data learn corridor-specific timing distributions. Which factors drive variance: intermediary count, currency pair, amount bracket, day of week, time of day, banking partner.

**Per-payment arrival prediction.** Before each payment is sent, the model predicts expected settlement time with confidence intervals. "This US-Singapore payment will settle in 28-36 hours (90\% confidence)." Not an average. A specific prediction for this specific payment on this specific day.

**Dynamic buffer optimization.** Instead of static 10-15\% buffers across all corridors, AI calculates the minimum buffer needed per corridor based on actual settlement distributions. Fast corridors get smaller buffers. Slow corridors get appropriately sized buffers. Total idle capital drops 30-40\%.

**Proactive alerting.** Real-time monitoring flags payments deviating from predicted settlement windows. Instead of ops teams checking status manually, they get alerts only when something is actually late.

Why this requires custom AI: your corridors, your banks, your timing patterns. Off-the-shelf treasury tools use industry averages. A US-Singapore payment through your specific correspondent chain behaves differently than the same corridor through another bank's chain. Custom ML learns your patterns from your data.

## What this means in dollars

For \$100M annual cross-border volume:

- Current buffer: ~\$1M idle
- With AI prediction (35\% reduction): \$650K idle
- Capital freed: \$350K back into operations
- Opportunity cost savings: ~\$28K/year
- Ops time savings: 10-12 hours/week in reduced status chasing
- Payback: 4 months

The real value isn't just the buffer reduction. It's that treasury can release downstream payments faster, vendors get paid on time, and your ops team stops spending a third of their week on settlement status checks.

## What you can do in the next 60 days

Start building the data foundation:

1. **Audit your last 90 days of settlements.** Calculate actual time from initiation to clearing for each corridor. Identify which corridors have the highest variance.
2. **Track actual timestamps.** Not just "sent" and "received," but the specific hour each payment cleared.
3. **Map variance by corridor, bank, and day of week.** Friday payments take longer. Month-end takes longer. Document it.
4. **Calculate your current buffer as a percentage of monthly volume.** Know what you're actually holding idle.

These steps quantify the problem. What you'll likely find is corridor-specific variance that static buffer rules can't address. That's where prediction AI creates leverage.

## How Devbrew builds this

At Devbrew, we build custom settlement prediction systems for US-based cross-border payments companies. Multi-bank data aggregation, corridor-specific ML models trained on your transaction history, per-payment arrival prediction with confidence intervals, and real-time deviation alerting.

We're not a TMS vendor. We're AI engineers who build prediction systems that integrate into your existing treasury workflow. The models learn from your data and get more accurate over time. Deployed in 60 days.

## See if prediction makes sense for your volume

If your treasury team can't predict when a specific payment will settle before sending it, you're holding excess capital on every corridor.

The goal of a conversation is to understand the settlement visibility challenges you're facing, what's at stake if they remain unsolved, and where AI can create meaningful leverage. You'll leave with clarity on your options, direction, and whether Devbrew can help.
