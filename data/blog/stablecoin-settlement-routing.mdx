---

The global average cost of sending \$200 cross-border is 6.5\%.[^1] Roughly one-third of retail cross-border payments reach the recipient within one hour.[^2] Your routing engine evaluates SWIFT, local clearing networks, maybe a few alternative providers. But there is a settlement rail it probably does not score yet: stablecoins are becoming infrastructure, and the companies that win will route through them alongside traditional networks, letting a model pick the fastest, cheapest path for every transaction.

## Why your routing engine is incomplete

Traditional routing engines score rails they were built to understand: SWIFT, local ACH networks, card networks, maybe a few alternative providers. Each transaction gets evaluated on cost, speed, and compliance clearance across these options. The router picks the best available path.

But stablecoins do not fit the traditional rail model. They settle on-chain, not through correspondent banking. Their cost structure is flat rather than corridor-dependent. Their compliance requirements are different: wallet screening and chain analytics instead of intermediary bank checks. Most routing engines have no framework for evaluating a rail that operates outside the correspondent banking system entirely.

That gap is becoming expensive. On high-cost corridors like US-to-Africa or US-to-Southeast Asia, stablecoin rails can settle the same transaction at a fraction of the cost. Every transaction your router sends through a traditional rail on those corridors, without even considering the stablecoin option, is money left on the table.

## How multi-rail routing works

Here is the system, step by step.

1. **Assess each transaction.** Corridor, amount, speed requirement, compliance jurisdiction, recipient capabilities. Not every transaction qualifies for stablecoin settlement.

2. **Score available rails in real time.** For each transaction, evaluate SWIFT, local instant payment networks, and stablecoin rails on cost, speed, compliance clearance, and destination liquidity. The model factors in current network fees, corridor-specific conversion rates, and regulatory constraints for each option.

3. **Apply the right compliance screening per rail.** Stablecoin transactions need wallet screening, chain analytics, and Travel Rule compliance. Traditional rails need correspondent banking checks. The system applies the appropriate screening based on the selected rail, not a one-size-fits-all stack.

4. **Manage treasury across fiat and stablecoin positions.** Predict liquidity needs across both pools. Automate conversion timing to minimize spread. Maintain reserve compliance under the GENIUS Act framework.

5. **Feed outcomes back into the model.** Track actual cost, speed, and success rate per rail per corridor. The model learns which rails outperform where and adjusts routing decisions over time.

## The mistakes payments teams make

**Dismissing stablecoins as crypto hype.** Stablecoin payment volume hit \$390 billion in 2025, more than doubling from the year before, and the stablecoin market cap reached \$270 billion.[^3][^5] The GENIUS Act made them federally regulated.[^4] Dismissing stablecoins means ceding corridors where they are already cheaper and faster to competitors who do not.

**Rushing to "add crypto" without rearchitecting compliance and treasury.** Stablecoin transactions carry different risk profiles than traditional transfers. Wallet screening, chain analytics, Travel Rule obligations. Teams that bolt on stablecoin support without updating their compliance and treasury operations create risk they cannot see until it surfaces.

**Building separate infrastructure per rail.** When you treat stablecoin rails as a standalone product instead of integrating them into your routing engine, you fragment liquidity, double operational complexity, and prevent the router from making intelligent per-transaction decisions. As we covered in how [correspondent fees](/blog/correspondent-fees-hidden-costs) compound across corridors, fragmented routing costs more than the sum of its parts.

## What the numbers look like

Stablecoin users report paying on average 40\% less in cross-border fees compared to traditional payment services, according to a 15-country survey of 4,658 users.[^6] In domestic payment routing, intelligent rail selection has demonstrated 26\% average cost savings, with some merchants seeing reductions above 50\%.[^7] On corridors where stablecoin rails are mature, settlement compresses from days to minutes.

The capital that sits trapped in transit while SWIFT messages clear gets unlocked. As we explained in how [settlement float](/blog/settlement-float-recovery) drains capital, every day a transaction sits in limbo is a day that working capital is unavailable to your treasury team. Multi-rail routing does not just cut costs. It accelerates your cash cycle.

## Why most teams cannot build this internally

The routing model is not a simple cost lookup. It is a multi-objective optimization across cost, speed, compliance risk, and destination liquidity, evaluated per transaction, per corridor, in real time. The model needs to learn corridor-specific patterns: which rails are reliable at which times, where liquidity is sufficient, where regulatory constraints apply. Most Series B-D teams do not have the ML engineering capacity for that.

Then there is compliance. Running traditional AML and KYC alongside wallet screening, chain analytics, and Travel Rule obligations means operating dual compliance stacks in production without creating gaps.

And treasury. Liquidity forecasting, conversion timing, and reserve compliance across fiat and stablecoin pools requires infrastructure most treasury systems were never built to handle.

## What you can do in the next 90 days

**Weeks 1 to 3: Audit your corridor economics.** Pull cost and speed data for your top 10 corridors. Calculate the fully loaded cost per transaction, including intermediary fees, FX spread, and pre-funding costs. Identify corridors where stablecoin rails could cut costs by 40\% or more.

**Weeks 4 to 6: Map your compliance gaps.** For candidate corridors, document what stablecoin settlement requires. GENIUS Act compliance, Travel Rule obligations, wallet screening needs. Measure the gap between your current compliance stack and what these corridors demand.

**Weeks 7 to 9: Build a routing decision framework.** Define the criteria your routing engine needs to evaluate for each transaction: cost threshold, speed requirement, compliance clearance, destination liquidity. Even before ML, a rules-based routing layer that scores stablecoin rails alongside traditional options is a meaningful first step.

**Weeks 10 to 12: Pilot one corridor.** Pick your highest-cost corridor with the clearest regulatory path. Route a subset of qualifying transactions through a stablecoin rail. Measure actual cost, speed, and failure rate against your traditional rail on the same corridor.

## How Devbrew builds multi-rail routing systems

At Devbrew, we build the AI routing and compliance infrastructure that lets payments companies integrate stablecoin rails without building separate systems for each settlement method. ML routing models, compliance screening across both rail types, treasury optimization. Custom AI trained on your transaction data and deployed into your existing payment stack so your engineering team stays focused on core product.

## Next step

If you are evaluating how stablecoin rails fit into your cross-border stack, we can walk through your corridors and identify where a multi-rail approach creates the most value.

The goal of this conversation is to understand the settlement challenge you are facing, what it is costing you, and where AI creates meaningful advantage in your routing decisions. You will leave with clarity on options, direction, and whether Devbrew can help.

When booking, share your top corridors and current transaction volume. It helps us make the most of our time together.
