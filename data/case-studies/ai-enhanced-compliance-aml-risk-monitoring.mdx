**Status:** **Coming Soon** - _This case study is currently in planning._

## The Problem

Financial institutions and fintech platforms face mounting compliance challenges that drain resources and expose them to regulatory risk:

**AML false positives overwhelm compliance teams.** Traditional rule-based transaction monitoring systems flag 95-98% false positives, forcing analysts to manually review thousands of alerts daily. This creates operational bottlenecks, delays legitimate transactions, and increases compliance costs.

**Money laundering typologies evolve faster than rules.** Sophisticated criminals adapt their patterns to evade detection, while static rule engines require months of manual tuning to catch new schemes. By the time rules are updated, attackers have moved on.

**KYC/KYB verification is slow and error-prone.** Manual document review for customer onboarding takes days, creates friction in user experience, and introduces human error in identity verification and sanctions screening.

**Regulatory penalties are severe.** AML violations result in multi-million dollar fines, reputational damage, and potential loss of banking licenses. Compliance teams need systems that detect genuine risk while maintaining audit trails for regulatory examination.

The industry needs AI-powered compliance systems that detect true money laundering activity, reduce false positives dramatically, automate document verification, and provide explainable risk scores that meet regulatory standards.

## The Planned Solution

We're planning an **AI-enhanced AML and compliance monitoring system** that demonstrates production-grade ML for financial crime prevention:

- **Intelligent transaction monitoring** using unsupervised learning (isolation forests, autoencoders) to detect anomalous patterns indicative of money laundering, structuring, and trade-based laundering
- **Typology-based risk scoring** with supervised models trained on known laundering schemes (layering, smurfing, cuckoo smurfing) to identify high-risk transaction sequences
- **Automated KYC/KYB document verification** using computer vision (OCR, document classification) and NLP to extract and validate identity information from passports, utility bills, and business registration documents
- **Entity resolution and network analysis** to uncover hidden relationships between accounts, beneficial owners, and shell companies
- **Explainable AI** providing clear rationale for every alert, showing which transaction patterns or document anomalies triggered the risk score

## What We'll Demonstrate

### Technical Capabilities

- **Anomaly Detection Models**: Isolation forests and autoencoders to identify unusual transaction patterns without relying on predefined rules, adapting to new laundering techniques
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Network analysis to detect circular money flows, layering schemes, and relationships between seemingly unrelated accounts
- **Computer Vision Pipeline**: Document classification, OCR extraction, and fraud detection (photoshop detection, template matching) for identity verification
- **NLP for Entity Matching**: Fuzzy name matching and entity resolution to link individuals across multiple accounts and jurisdictions
- **Risk Scoring Framework**: Calibrated probability outputs with configurable thresholds for different risk appetites and regulatory requirements
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Complete logging of model decisions, feature values, and analyst actions for regulatory examination

### Target Outcomes

Upon completion, this case study will demonstrate:

- **70% reduction in false positive alerts** through ML-based anomaly detection vs. rule-based systems
- **50% faster investigation times** via automated document verification and pre-populated case summaries
- **90%+ accuracy in document fraud detection** using computer vision to identify forged or altered identity documents
- **Regulatory-compliant explainability** with auditable decision trails and model documentation meeting BSA/AML requirements

### Technology Stack Considerations

- **ML Framework**: Python with scikit-learn (isolation forests), TensorFlow/PyTorch (autoencoders, CNNs), NetworkX (graph analysis)
- **Computer Vision**: Tesseract OCR, OpenCV for image preprocessing, pre-trained CNNs for document classification
- **NLP**: spaCy for entity extraction, RapidFuzz for fuzzy matching, transformers for semantic similarity
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for entity relationship mapping and network analysis queries
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for real-time risk scoring and document verification endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Alert queue management, analyst feedback loops, and model performance dashboards

## Industry Applications

This approach is applicable to:

- **Digital banks and neobanks** managing AML compliance for retail and business accounts
- **Payment processors** screening high-volume transaction flows for suspicious activity
- **Cryptocurrency exchanges** detecting wash trading, layering, and cross-chain laundering
- **Money service businesses (MSBs)** automating KYC verification for remittance customers
- **Banking-as-a-Service platforms** providing compliance infrastructure to embedded finance partners
- **Wealth management firms** monitoring client transactions for insider trading and market manipulation

## Regulatory Context

This system will be designed to support compliance with:

- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** and **USA PATRIOT Act** requirements for transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting (SARs)
- **FinCEN regulations** for customer due diligence (CDD) and beneficial ownership identification
- **EU AML Directives (AMLD5/AMLD6)** for risk-based customer screening and enhanced due diligence
- **FATF Recommendations** for risk assessment and mitigation in cross-border transactions

All models will include explainability features required for regulatory examination and audit defense.

## Data & Research Approach

This reference implementation will use publicly available datasets and synthetic data to demonstrate production-grade ML engineering:

- **Synthetic AML transaction data** generated using agent-based simulation of known laundering typologies
- **Public sanctions lists** (OFAC, EU, UN) for entity screening benchmarks
- **Document verification datasets** using publicly available identity document templates and synthetic fraud examples
- **Academic AML datasets** from research institutions studying financial crime detection

All techniques will be designed for easy adaptation to proprietary transaction and customer data in production deployments.

## Stay Updated

This case study is currently in development. We're designing the architecture, researching AML typologies, and planning the technical implementation.
