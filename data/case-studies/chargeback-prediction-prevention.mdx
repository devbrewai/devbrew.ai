**Status:** **Coming Soon** - _This case study is currently in planning._

## The Problem

Payments platforms, BNPL providers, and e-commerce merchants face mounting chargeback challenges that directly impact profitability and customer experience:

**Chargebacks erode margins and create operational overhead.** The average chargeback costs merchants $3.60 per dispute in fees, plus the lost revenue from disputed transactions. For high-volume platforms processing millions of transactions, this translates to millions in annual losses.

**Reactive dispute management is too late.** By the time a chargeback is filed, the damage is done. Merchants lose revenue, face processing fees, and risk account termination if chargeback ratios exceed thresholds. Current systems only respond after disputes occur.

**Prevention strategies are blunt instruments.** Many platforms apply blanket fraud prevention measures that hurt conversion rates. Step-up authentication, manual review queues, and delayed fulfillment create friction for legitimate customers while missing actual fraud.

**Risk assessment lacks precision.** Traditional fraud scoring focuses on identity verification but doesn't account for merchant-specific patterns, product categories, or customer behavior that predict chargeback likelihood.

The industry needs AI-powered systems that predict chargeback risk before transactions complete, enabling targeted prevention strategies that reduce disputes without crushing conversion rates.

## The Planned Solution

We're planning an **AI-powered chargeback prediction and prevention system** that demonstrates production-grade ML for dispute reduction:

- **Predictive risk scoring** using gradient boosting models trained on transaction patterns, customer behavior, and merchant metadata to identify high-risk orders before completion
- **Dynamic prevention strategies** with configurable risk bands that trigger appropriate interventions (step-up auth, delayed fulfillment, manual review) based on predicted chargeback probability
- **Merchant-specific modeling** that adapts to different product categories, customer segments, and business models to optimize risk-return tradeoffs
- **Real-time decisioning** with sub-500ms inference latency for seamless checkout experiences
- **Explainable AI** providing clear rationale for risk scores and prevention recommendations to build merchant trust and enable policy tuning

## What We'll Demonstrate

### Technical Capabilities

- **Multi-Source Feature Engineering**: Aggregating transaction data, customer history, device fingerprints, and merchant metadata to build comprehensive risk profiles
- **Temporal Validation**: Time-series cross-validation to ensure models generalize across different time periods and seasonal patterns
- **Ensemble ML Models**: Gradient boosting (LightGBM/CatBoost) with calibrated probability outputs for precise chargeback risk prediction across merchant segments
- **Risk Band Optimization**: Automated threshold tuning to balance prevention effectiveness with conversion impact
- **Prevention Policy Engine**: YAML-configurable rules that map risk scores to specific interventions (3DS, AVS, manual review, delayed capture)
- **Uplift Modeling**: Quantifying the net benefit of prevention strategies by measuring conversion impact vs. chargeback reduction
- **Real-time API**: FastAPI endpoints for instant risk scoring and prevention recommendations during checkout flows

### Target Outcomes

Upon completion, this case study will demonstrate:

- **20-35% reduction in chargeback rates** through early risk detection and targeted prevention
- **Precision ≥80% at top decile** for chargeback prediction on holdout validation sets
- **Less than 2% conversion impact** from prevention strategies through precise risk band targeting
- **ROI-positive prevention** with net savings exceeding intervention costs across merchant segments

### Technology Stack Considerations

- **ML Framework**: Python with LightGBM/CatBoost for categorical features, scikit-learn for calibration, SHAP for explainability
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for real-time risk scoring with async processing and Redis for caching
- **Policy Engine**: YAML-based configuration with rule evaluation and action triggering
- **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking, drift detection, and prevention effectiveness dashboards
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized deployment with horizontal scaling for high-volume transaction processing

## Industry Applications

This approach is applicable to:

- **Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) platforms** preventing disputes on installment payments and reducing merchant chargeback exposure
- **Marketplace processors** protecting sellers from fraudulent buyers and reducing platform liability
- **Subscription commerce platforms** identifying high-risk recurring payments before customer acquisition
- **Digital goods merchants** preventing chargebacks on intangible products where physical delivery verification isn't possible
- **High-risk merchants** in travel, electronics, and luxury goods where chargeback rates typically exceed industry averages
- **Payment facilitators** providing chargeback prevention as a value-added service to merchant clients

## Prevention Strategy Framework

The system will implement a tiered prevention approach:

- **High Risk (Top 5%)**: Step-up authentication (3DS), manual review, or transaction decline with clear customer communication
- **Medium Risk (5-15%)**: Delayed capture, partial fulfillment, or enhanced verification (AVS, device fingerprinting)
- **Low Risk (Bottom 85%)**: Pass through with lightweight logging and monitoring for pattern detection

Each strategy will be calibrated to merchant-specific conversion tolerance and chargeback cost structures.

## Data & Research Approach

This reference implementation will use publicly available datasets and synthetic data to demonstrate production-grade ML engineering:

- **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset** for transaction pattern analysis and feature engineering techniques
- **Synthetic chargeback data** generated using agent-based simulation of known dispute patterns and merchant behaviors
- **Public merchant category codes (MCC)** for industry-specific risk modeling and prevention strategy optimization
- **Simulated customer journey data** including device fingerprints, session patterns, and behavioral signals

All models and techniques will be designed for easy adaptation to proprietary transaction and customer data in production deployments.

## ROI and Business Impact

The case study will demonstrate measurable business value through:

- **Loss Prevention**: Direct savings from prevented chargebacks (transaction value + processing fees)
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual review volume and faster dispute resolution
- **Merchant Retention**: Lower chargeback ratios preventing account termination and processing restrictions
- **Revenue Protection**: Maintaining conversion rates while reducing fraud exposure

Expected ROI calculations will show payback periods under 6 months for merchants processing >$1M monthly volume.
