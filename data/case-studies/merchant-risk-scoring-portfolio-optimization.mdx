**Status:** **Coming Soon** - _This case study is currently in planning._

## The Problem

Merchant acquirers, ISOs, and payment service providers face significant challenges in managing portfolio risk and optimizing underwriting processes:

**Portfolio concentration risk goes undetected.** Risk teams struggle to identify emerging bad actors and concentration patterns until losses materialize. Traditional monitoring focuses on individual transactions rather than merchant-level risk profiles, missing systemic issues.

**Manual underwriting doesn't scale.** Human review processes create bottlenecks, increase operational costs, and introduce inconsistency across merchant segments. Risk teams lack data-driven frameworks to prioritize reviews and allocate resources effectively.

**Static risk assessment misses evolving threats.** Merchant risk profiles change over time, but traditional scoring models rely on outdated snapshots. New merchants lack sufficient transaction history for accurate risk assessment, while established merchants may develop risk patterns that go unnoticed.

**Review capacity is misallocated.** Risk teams spend equal time reviewing low-risk and high-risk merchants, reducing overall portfolio protection while increasing operational overhead. Without tiered risk management, resources are spread thin across the entire merchant base.

The industry needs AI-powered merchant risk scoring that identifies high-risk merchants early, optimizes review schedules, and provides portfolio-level insights to reduce fraud exposure while improving operational efficiency.

## The Planned Solution

We're planning an **AI-powered merchant risk scoring and portfolio optimization system** that demonstrates production-grade ML for merchant risk management:

- **Comprehensive merchant profiling** using unsupervised clustering to segment merchants by behavior patterns, transaction characteristics, and risk indicators
- **Predictive risk scoring** with supervised models trained on merchant metadata, transaction aggregates, and forward-looking loss data to predict future fraud exposure
- **Portfolio optimization** with simulation capabilities to model portfolio loss reduction under different review strategies and capacity constraints
- **Tiered risk management** with automated merchant segmentation (Tiers A-D) and configurable review schedules based on risk levels
- **Real-time portfolio monitoring** with dashboards showing concentration risk, emerging threats, and portfolio-level exposure metrics

## What We'll Demonstrate

### Technical Capabilities

- **Merchant Feature Engineering**: Aggregating transaction data, chargeback rates, refund patterns, velocity metrics, and geographic distribution to build comprehensive merchant profiles
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: K-means and hierarchical clustering to identify merchant segments with similar risk characteristics and behavioral patterns
- **Supervised Risk Scoring**: Gradient boosting models (LightGBM) trained on merchant aggregates to predict future loss rates and dispute patterns
- **Temporal Validation**: Forward-looking validation using 30-90 day loss windows to ensure model generalization across time periods
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation to model portfolio loss reduction under different review strategies and capacity constraints
- **Risk Tier Calibration**: Automated threshold optimization to create meaningful merchant tiers with clear risk differentiation
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Real-time dashboards tracking concentration risk, MCC distribution, geographic exposure, and review efficiency metrics

### Target Outcomes

Upon completion, this case study will demonstrate:

- **15-25% reduction in portfolio fraud exposure** through early identification of high-risk merchants
- **30% reduction in manual review volume** by focusing resources on merchants with highest loss potential
- **Clear risk separation between tiers** with top risk decile containing materially higher share of future losses
- **ROI-positive risk management** with review cost savings exceeding fraud prevention benefits

### Technology Stack Considerations

- **ML Framework**: Python with scikit-learn for clustering, LightGBM for supervised scoring, pandas for feature engineering
- **Data Processing**: DuckDB or PostgreSQL for merchant aggregates and portfolio analytics
- **API Layer**: FastAPI for merchant scoring and portfolio simulation endpoints
- **Dashboard**: Next.js with interactive portfolio visualizations and merchant management interfaces
- **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking, portfolio drift detection, and review efficiency metrics

## Industry Applications

This approach is applicable to:

- **Merchant acquirers** managing portfolios of thousands of merchants across diverse industries and risk profiles
- **Payment service providers (PSPs)** providing risk management services to merchant clients and optimizing portfolio exposure
- **Commerce platforms** with in-house merchant onboarding and risk management for marketplace sellers
- **ISO/MSP organizations** managing merchant portfolios and providing risk assessment services to acquirers
- **Fintech platforms** offering merchant services and needing sophisticated risk management capabilities
- **Cross-border payment providers** managing international merchant portfolios with varying regulatory requirements

## Risk Management Framework

The system will implement a comprehensive merchant risk management approach:

- **Tier A (Low Risk)**: Annual reviews, automated monitoring, minimal intervention
- **Tier B (Medium Risk)**: Quarterly reviews, enhanced monitoring, targeted interventions
- **Tier C (High Risk)**: Monthly reviews, intensive monitoring, proactive risk mitigation
- **Tier D (Critical Risk)**: Weekly reviews, immediate intervention, potential account termination

Each tier will have specific review schedules, monitoring frequencies, and intervention strategies calibrated to merchant risk levels.

## Data & Research Approach

This reference implementation will use publicly available datasets and synthetic data to demonstrate production-grade ML engineering:

- **Synthetic merchant transaction data** generated using agent-based simulation of merchant behavior patterns and risk characteristics
- **Public merchant category codes (MCC)** for industry-specific risk modeling and portfolio segmentation
- **Simulated loss and dispute data** with realistic temporal patterns and merchant-specific risk factors
- **Portfolio simulation datasets** including merchant lifecycle patterns, seasonal variations, and concentration risk scenarios

All models and techniques will be designed for easy adaptation to proprietary merchant and transaction data in production deployments.

## Portfolio Optimization Benefits

The case study will demonstrate measurable business value through:

- **Loss Prevention**: Early identification of high-risk merchants before significant losses occur
- **Operational Efficiency**: Optimized review schedules reducing manual effort by 30% while improving risk coverage
- **Portfolio Insights**: Data-driven understanding of concentration risk and emerging threats
- **Resource Allocation**: Focused review capacity on merchants with highest loss potential
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trails and risk documentation for regulatory examination

Expected ROI calculations will show payback periods under 4 months for acquirers managing portfolios with >$100M annual volume.
