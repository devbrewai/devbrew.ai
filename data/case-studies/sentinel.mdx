## The results

**55% cost reduction**\
Cost-optimized decision thresholds vs. baseline

**30ms API latency**\
Real-time scoring that doesn't slow down checkout

**97% sanctions precision**\
Screen against OFAC lists with confidence

**ROC-AUC 0.8861**\
Exceeds the 0.85 industry benchmark for fraud detection

---

## The problem

Payment companies face impossible tradeoffs:

**Fraud is rising**: Card-not-present fraud costs billions annually

**False positives kill conversion**: Legacy systems flag 10-20% of good customers

**Compliance is complex**: OFAC screening must happen in milliseconds

Traditional rule-based systems can't keep up with evolving fraud patterns.

---

## The solution

Sentinel combines ML-based fraud detection with real-time sanctions screening:

### Fraud detection

- LightGBM gradient boosting trained on 429 features
- Explainable AI (SHAP values) for regulatory compliance
- Calibrated probabilities with cost-optimized thresholds

### Sanctions screening

- Fuzzy name matching against 39,350 OFAC entities
- Handles typos, name variations, and transliterations
- Sub-50ms screening with 97.5% precision

### Production-ready API

- FastAPI with async processing
- Redis caching for sub-200ms latency
- PostgreSQL audit logs for compliance

---

## How it works

1. **Submit a transaction** via REST API or demo UI
2. **Get instant results**: fraud risk score, SHAP explanations, sanctions match
3. **Make informed decisions** with transparent, auditable predictions

Built with LightGBM, FastAPI, Redis, and Next.js.

## Research project disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> This is a **research case study** demonstrating production-grade ML engineering. Models are trained on public datasets (IEEE-CIS, PaySim) for **non-commercial research use only**.
>
> **For production deployments:** We train custom models on your transaction data, achieving 20-30% higher accuracy by learning your specific fraud patterns.

## Pilot Sentinel with your transaction data

We're offering **free pilots** to Series A-C payments companies.

### What you get

- Custom fraud detection model trained on your transaction data
- 2-3 week side-by-side comparison with your current system
- Detailed analysis: accuracy improvements, false positive reduction, cost savings

### What we need

- Access to 3-6 months of historical transaction data (anonymized customer data accepted)
- Weekly check-ins to review results and gather feedback
- A testimonial if we reduce false positives by 20%+ or improve fraud detection by 15%+

**No cost. No long-term commitment.** If we don't hit the improvement threshold, you've lost nothing. If we do, you get early access to production-ready fraud detection built for your specific patterns.

**Spots available:** 5 companies per month
