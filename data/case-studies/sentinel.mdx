## The problem

Payment processors and financial institutions face a dual challenge that costs billions annually:

**Fraud losses are escalating.** Card-not-present (CNP) transactions, the backbone of e-commerce and cross-border payments, are increasingly targeted by sophisticated fraud rings. Traditional rule-based systems can't keep pace with evolving attack patterns.

**False positives kill conversion.** Legacy fraud systems flag 10-20% of legitimate transactions as suspicious, forcing manual review queues that delay payments, frustrate customers, and cost millions in lost revenue.

**Compliance is non-negotiable.** Every cross-border payment must be screened against OFAC, EU, and UN sanctions lists in real-time. Slow or inaccurate screening creates regulatory risk and operational bottlenecks.

The industry needs a solution that detects fraud accurately, reduces false positives dramatically, and maintains sub-200ms latency, all while meeting compliance requirements.

## The solution

We built an **AI-powered fraud detection and sanctions screening pipeline** that demonstrates production-grade ML engineering for financial services:

- **High-accuracy fraud detection** using ensemble gradient boosting models (LightGBM) achieving ROC-AUC of 0.8861 (exceeding industry benchmarks)
- **Intelligent sanctions screening** with fuzzy matching algorithms (RapidFuzz) against OFAC SDN and Consolidated Lists, achieving 97.5% precision while handling name variations
- **Real-time inference** with sub-200ms API latency through optimized model serving and caching strategies
- **Explainable AI** using SHAP values to provide transparent, auditable predictions that meet regulatory requirements

### System architecture & capabilities

**Fraud detection engine**

- **ML models**: LightGBM gradient boosting (1.18 MB, 295 trees) optimized for imbalanced fraud datasets, delivering ROC-AUC 0.8861 and PR-AUC 0.4743
- **Feature engineering**: 429 production-grade features including velocity counters (transaction frequency by time windows), device fingerprinting, BIN-IP geographic mismatch detection, and z-scored transaction amounts
- **Decision optimization**: Isotonic regression calibration (ECE 0.0050) with cost-sensitive thresholds demonstrating $225K in potential savings at optimal operating point
- **Explainability**: SHAP TreeExplainer providing regulatory-compliant feature attribution with \<10ms inference overhead

**Sanctions screening module**

- **Fuzzy matching**: Token-based composite scoring (token set + token sort + partial ratio) using RapidFuzz to handle name variations, transliterations, and common data quality issues
- **Performance**: 97.5% precision at top-1, 98.0% recall at top-3, with 47.51ms p95 latency
- **Smart filtering**: Multi-strategy blocking achieving 100% recall with 99% search space reduction across 39,350 OFAC entities
- **Confidence scoring**: Three-tier decision logic (match ≥0.90, review 0.80-0.90, no match \<0.80) with probabilistic match scoring
- **Compliance trail**: Complete audit logging of all screening decisions with match rationale

**Production-ready API infrastructure**

- **Service layer**: FastAPI-based REST API with `/score` endpoint delivering fraud risk scores, SHAP explanations, and sanctions matches in a single request (~30ms p95 latency)
- **Performance optimization**: Redis caching for velocity features and parallel execution of fraud scoring + sanctions screening
- **Data persistence**: PostgreSQL for audit logs, transaction history, and compliance reporting
- **Observability**: Structured logging, request tracing, and performance metrics for production monitoring

**Interactive demo dashboard**
